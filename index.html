W. Tozer is known for many things. He's known for his powerful writing style. He's known for being vigorously biblical. And he&#x2019;s known for gazing upon God intently in Scripture, and then telling readers plainly what he sees. </p><p>These aspects of Tozer shine through in <i>Meditations on the Trinity</i>. Tozer&#x2019;s writings are first and foremost about our triune God. This hard-cover volume&#x2014;beautifully designed with a two-color interior&#x2014;compiles excerpts from his writings into a collection of daily readings on the Godhead. It consists of four parts: one part on each respective person of the Trinity, and one on God three-in-one.<br><br>Can a Christian ever finish contemplating the Trinity? It is an inexhaustible mystery, but one that rewards continual reflection. Readers of <i>Meditations on the Trinity</i> will receive a more accurate view of who God is, and in turn&#x2014;as Tozer would be quick to point out&#x2014;offer Him truer worship. Knowing God is the chief end of man, and this book will help readers nearer that goal. </p><p><b>Product features that make&nbsp;this an&nbsp;ideal gift&nbsp;include:</b></p><ul><li>Bonded leather over&nbsp;hardcover</li><li>Rounded corners</li><li>Perimeter stitching</li><li>Ribbon marker</li><li>Heavy slip case</li></ul></p><p><b>A.W. TOZER</b> began his lifelong pursuit of God at the age of seventeen after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. A self-taught theologian, Tozer was a pastor, writer and editor whose powerful use of words continues to grip the intellect and stir the soul of today's reader. Among his best-loved books are the classics <i>The Pursuit of God</i> and <i>The Attributes of God</i>.</p><h2>Margaret Mitchell &amp; John Marsh: The Love Story Behind Gone With the Wind</h2><p>Traces the life of Margaret Mitchell and her twenty-four-year marriage to John Marsh, and describes how he helped her create her Pulitzer prize winning novel</p><p>Based on almost 200 previously unpublished letters and extensive interviews with their closest associates, Walker's biography of Margaret Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, offers a new look into a devoted marriage and fascinating partnership that ultimately created a Pulitzer Prize winning novel. This edition of Walker's biography celebrates the seventy-fifth anniversary of the publication of Gone With the Wind in 1936.<p> In lively extracts from their letters to family and friends, John and Margaret, who also went by Peggy, describe the stormy years of their courtship, their bohemian lifestyle as a young married couple, the arduous but fulfilling years when Peggy was writing her famous novel, the thrill of its acceptance for publication and its literary success, and the excitement of the making of the movie. In telling the private side of this twenty-four-year marriage, author Marianne Walker reveals a long-suspected truth: Gone With the Wind might have never been written were it not for John Marsh. He was Peggy's best friend and constant champion, and he became her editor, proofreader, researcher, business manager, and the inspiration and motivation behind her writing. At every point, including the turbulent years of Mitchell's first marriage to Red Upshaw, it was John who provided the intellectual stimulation, emotional support, and editorial insights that allowed Peggy to channel her talents into the creation of her astounding Civil War epic. Through years of meticulous research, Marianne Walker reveals the intimate and moving love story between a husband and wife, and between a writer and her editor.</p>In 1985, Marianne Walker was asked to give a talk on GONE WITH THE WIND. She had never read the novel, but when she learned that John Marsh, the husband of author Margaret Mitchell, was from nearby Marysville, Kentucky, she decided to look further into the subject. <p>Walker's search led her all over Kentucky, then much of the rest of the country. She interviewed many people who were close to the couple and found newpaper clippings, photographs, telegram, and, most importantly, 200 never-before-published letters from Mitchell and Marsh to their family and friends. The result of this research is this book. </p><p>Marianne Walker has also written for the New York Times Book Review and the Louisville Courier-Journal. She is a professor of English and philosophy at the University of Kentucky/Henderson Community College, where she has taught for seventeen years. Born in Monroe, Louisiana and a graduate of St. Mary's Dominican College in New Orleans, she received her M.A. from the University of Evansville in Indiana in 1976.</p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Macroeconomics</h2><p><p>Built to focus on what matters to students in today&#x2019;s high-tech, globalized world, Dean Karlan and Jonathan Morduch&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Economics</em> represents a new generation of products, optimized for digital delivery and available with best-in-class adaptive study resources in McGraw-Hill Connect.

It&#39;s His nature. But many times we have to make the way ourselves. It&#39;s not until we realize that we really don&#39;t know what to do that we are able to hear God&#39;s voice. That&#39;swhen He says, &#34;Why don&#39;t we try this My Way?&#34; God Will Make A Way is an approach to solving specific problems, but more than that, it&#39;s a new approach to life itself. Drs. Cloud and Townsend introduce &#34;ten life principles&#34; and then demonstrate how eighteen real-world dilemmas are solved by their application. The book concludes with a plan to encourage each reader to develop a personal strategy for using these principles to bring about life changing healing.</p><p>Life is difficult. Life for every person on earth is a challenging journey &#x2013; with or without God. Those who invite God to join them on this adventure believe that when bad things happen they can trust God to be present and work on their behalf. <p>But because we never know when, where, or how God is going to show up, we often wonder: Just exactly how does He go about the business of helping us when we don&#x2019;t know what to do? </p><p>Henry Cloud and John Townsend believe God has given us instructions on how He makes a way for us when we call on Him. They believe that, just as you would exercise faith in a doctor by following his advice to get well physically, if you follow God&#x2019;s eight principles in this book, you can thrive relationally, emotionally, and spiritually. </p><p>These principles offer a groundbreaking new approach to recognizing when God is present and how He works His will in our lives.THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WAY </p><p>- Begin your journey with God </p><p>- Choose your traveling companions wisely </p><p>- Place high value on wisdom </p><p>- Leave your baggage behind </p><p>- Own your faults and weaknesses </p><p>- Embrace problems as gifts </p><p>- Take life as it comes </p><p>- Love God with all you are </p><p>As clinical psychologists, the authors deal daily with real people facing real problems, so this book is not just psychological or biblical theory: In fact, Part II of God Will Make a Way shows the principles at work in twelve key areas of life: dating, marriage, sex, conflict, parenting, fear, lost love, addictions, anger, depression, weight loss, and personal goals. </p><p>God Will Make a Way is more than a remarkably helpful book. It is a life system that captures God&#x2019;s wisdom for coping with our most difficult problems.</p>Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend both graduated with doctorates in clinical psychology from Rosemead Graduate School of Psychology at Biola University and both maintain private practices in Newport Beach, California.

THE HEALING TIMELINE, unlike any method before it, &#x2018;proves&#x2019; to the brain that trauma and emotional distress are over. It is an accelerated path to emotional healing. With warmth and clarity, Catherine Thorpe, MA, describes THE HEALING TIMELINE through case examples and specific directions for pastors, counselors and anyone involved in the emotional healing of others. By using systematic repetitions of a timeline, comprised of real memories from a client&#x2019;s life, the distress associated with a memory can be resolved. The lasting outcomes from this method enable clients to think, feel and live differently in significantly less time than talk therapy alone. It is highly effective with children and adults for trauma, sexual abuse and relationship issues. THE HEALING TIMELINE is a simple, yet profound, new contribution to counseling.</p><p></p><h2>Geology: A Self-Teaching Guide</h2><p>Take a learning journey through billions of years of Earthhistory<br> <br> This indispensable guide to the fundamentals of geology is theideal way to introduce yourself to all the basics, from rocks,minerals, and fossil fuels to earthquakes, volcanoes, and platetectonics.

With the stories of these workers, <i>Coolies and Cane</i> advances an interpretation of emancipation that moves beyond U.S. borders and the black-white racial dynamic. Tracing American ideas of Asian labor to the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, Moon-Ho Jung argues that the racial formation of "coolies" in American culture and law played a pivotal role in reconstructing concepts of race, nation, and citizenship in the United States.</p><p>Jung examines how coolies appeared in major U.S. political debates on race, labor, and immigration between the 1830s and 1880s. He finds that racial notions of coolies were articulated in many, often contradictory, ways. They could mark the progress of freedom; they could also symbolize the barbarism of slavery. Welcomed and rejected as neither black nor white, coolies emerged recurrently as both the salvation of the fracturing and reuniting nation and the scourge of American civilization.</p><p>Based on extensive archival research, this study makes sense of these contradictions to reveal how American impulses to recruit and exclude coolies enabled and justified a series of historical transitions: from slave-trade laws to racially coded immigration laws, from a slaveholding nation to a "nation of immigrants," and from a continental empire of manifest destiny to a liberating empire across the seas.</p><p>Combining political, cultural, and social history, <i>Coolies and Cane</i> is a compelling study of race, Reconstruction, and Asian American history.</p></p><p><p>Winner, Merle Curti Award, Organization of American Historians<br>Winner, History Book Award, Association for Asian American Studies</p><p>How did thousands of Chinese migrants end up working alongside African Americans in Louisiana after the Civil War?

You see, I find nothing in literature that is valuable simply for its professional quality: literature is only valuable in the measure of the passion&#x2014;the blood and muscle&#x2014;with which it is invested&#x2014;which lies concealed and active in it.2</p> <p>Emerson would agree. As he wrote in his journal of 1845, &#x201c;Writing should be the settlement of dew on the leaf, of stalactites on the wall of the grotto, the deposit of flesh from the blood, of woody fibre in the tree from the sap.&#x201d;3 It was not only that the words need to be created from an author&#x2019;s lifeblood, however, but that it must produce a correspondent passion in the reader: &#x201c;Let us answer a book of ink with a book of flesh and blood.&#x201d;4 The right use of books, the &#x201c;one end which all means go to effect,&#x201d; he wrote, is &#x201c;for nothing but to inspire. I had better never see a book than to be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit, and made a satellite instead of a system. The one thing in the world, of value, is the active soul.&#x201d;5</p> <p>Like Henry David Thoreau, who, in <i>Walden</i>, wanted to wake his neighbors up, Emerson said of his neighbors while in the midst of writing his first book, <i>Nature</i>: &#x201c;They want awakening. Get the soul out of bed, out of her deep habitual sleep, out into God&#x2019;s universe, to a perception of its beauty, and hearing of its call, and your vulgar man, your prosy, selfish sensualist awakes, a god, and is conscious of force to shake the world.&#x201d;6</p> <p>Emerson did not want a generation of disciples, of followers, but of original thinkers. &#x201c;I have been writing and speaking what were once called novelties, for twenty-five or thirty years, and have not now one disciple. Why?&#x201d; Emerson asked in 1859:</p> <p>Not that what I said was not true; not that it has not found intelligent receivers but because it did not go from any wish in me to bring men to me, but to themselves. I delight in driving them from me. What could I do, if they came to me?&#x2014;they would interrupt and encumber me. This is my boast that I have no school &amp; no follower. I should account it a measure of the impurity of insight, if it did not create independence.7</p> <p>Those thought of as disciples, such as Thoreau or Margaret Fuller or Amos Bronson Alcott, were appreciated by Emerson for their originality and perception, their ability to &#x201c;alter my state of mind,&#x201d;8 and because he found in them &#x201c;souls that made our souls wiser.&#x201d;9</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;</p> <p>Between May 25, 1803, when he was born without ceremony in the First Church parsonage in Boston to Reverend William and Ruth Haskins Emerson, and April 27, 1882, when the bell of the First Parish in Concord tolled seventy-nine times announcing his death from pneumonia, Ralph Waldo Emerson had become one of America&#x2019;s leading intellectuals, earning him the epithet, the Sage of Concord. &#x201c;Great geniuses have the shortest biographies,&#x201d; Emerson wrote. &#x201c;Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their house and street life was trivial and commonplace.&#x201d;10</p> <p>Many who achieve prominence show no particular marks of distinction and promise in their early years. Emerson was no exception. He attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College as a satisfactory student, teaching after graduation in various schools until he decided to prepare for the ministry by attending the Harvard Divinity School. Once licensed to preach he found himself welcome at many pulpits around Boston; he finally accepted a position as colleague, or junior, pastor&#x2014;soon promoted to pastor&#x2014;at the Second Church in Boston.</p> <p>In December 1827 Emerson met Ellen Louisa Tucker. She was sixteen, with a sweet and kind disposition, and tubercular, a condition they either ignored or hoped she would overcome. They married in 1829. Sixteen months later Emerson was a widower. Emerson&#x2019;s aunt, Mary Moody Emerson, wrote shortly before Ellen&#x2019;s death, &#x201c;Waldo has borne so well his personal trials&#x2014;has done &amp; labored so much for his family that it is grievous to find him so tried&#x2014;he is discouraged about this lovely flower who has so captivated his affections.&#x201d;11</p> <p>After Ellen&#x2019;s death, Emerson found himself in conflict with the Second Church over the administration of the sacrament, a ritual from which he believed &#x201c;the life and suitableness have departed,&#x201d; making it &#x201c;as worthless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the dead leaves that are falling around us.&#x201d;12 He had begun his lifelong process of thought, consideration, evaluation, and realignment, in a cycle that left no concept secure, and damned &#x201c;foolish consistency&#x201d; as the &#x201c;hobgoblin of little minds.&#x201d;13 As he would write in his essay &#x201c;Circles,&#x201d; &#x201c;No truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts.&#x201d;14</p> <p>&#x201c;The true preacher,&#x201d; Emerson wrote, &#x201c;can be known by this, that he deals out to the people his life,&#x2014;life passed through the fire of thought.&#x201d;15 To be a true preacher for Emerson left him no recourse but to resign his pastorate. Freedom was the &#x201c;essence&#x201d;16 of faith. A few days after leaving the Second Church in December 1831 he sailed for Europe, visiting the great sites of Italy and France, but it was in England and Scotland where, having met William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a man who would be a lifelong friend, Thomas Carlyle, his world changed. Although he did not yet know in what way, the life he left behind in America was not the life he was returning to.</p> <p>His journal during his European period shows a mind receptive to, sparked and animated by, all his experiences: places he visited, things he saw, events he witnessed, and people he met, all offering new perspectives. When visiting the Jardin des Plantes in Paris he wrote in a notebook that he was</p> <p>impressed with the inexhaustible riches of nature. The universe is a more amazing puzzle than ever, as you glance along this bewildering series of animated forms&#x2014;the hazy butterflies, the carved shells, the birds, beasts, fishes, insects, snakes, and the upheaving principle of life everywhere so incipient, in the very rock aping organized forms. Not a form so grotesque, so savage, nor so beautiful but is an expression of some property inherent in man the observer&#x2014;an occult relation between the very scorpions and man. I feel the centipede in me&#x2014;cayman, carp, eagle, and fox. I am moved by strange sympathies; I say continually, &#x201c;I will be a naturalist.&#x201d;17</p> <p>His experiences in Paris informed Emerson&#x2019;s lecture, &#x201c;The Uses of Natural History,&#x201d; in which he explained natural history as a lexicon of the language of God and the universe:</p> <p>Every fact that is disclosed to us in natural history removes one scale more from the eye; makes the face of nature around us so much more significant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thus knowledge will make the face of the earth significant for us: it will make the stone speak and clothe with grace the meanest weed. Indeed it is worth considering in all animated nature what different aspects the same object presents to the ignorant and the instructed eye.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is in my judgment the greatest office of natural science, and one which as yet is only begun to be discharged, to explain man to himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The knowledge of all the facts of all the laws of nature will give man his true place in the system of being.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nature is a language and every new fact we learn is a new word.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish to learn this language&#x2014;not that I may know a new grammar but that I may read the great book which is written in that tongue.18</p> <p>Although Emerson continued to preach sermons throughout the 1830s, the number of moralistically religious addresses tapered off rapidly toward the end of the decade as he delivered more discourses and lectures on diverse themes that might attract a wider audience. His interest in science and nature had been expanding since the 1830s. By the 1840s he was speaking increasingly on such issues as abolitionism, Indian rights, America&#x2019;s focus on materialism, and society&#x2019;s increasing lack of spiritual support and focus. For Emerson, though, there may have been little difference between the church and the lyceum. As Elizabeth Peabody wrote:</p> <p>I think Mr. Emerson was always pre-eminently the preacher to his own generation and future ones, but as much&#x2014;if not more&#x2014;out of the pulpit as in it; faithful unto the end to his early chosen profession and the vows of his youth. Whether he spoke in the pulpit or lyceum chair, or to friends in his hospitable parlor, or <i>t�te-�-t�te</i> in his study, or in his favorite walks in the woods with chosen companions, or at the festive gatherings of scholars, or in the conventions of philanthropists, or in the popular assemblies of patriots in times and on occasions that try men&#x2019;s souls, always and everywhere it was his conscious purpose to utter a &#x201c;Thus saith the Lord.&#x201d;19</p> <p>In 1837 Emerson delivered &#x201c;The American Scholar&#x201d; before the Phi Beta Kappa Society in Cambridge. It was an attack on our dependence on the past and a call to arms for a new generation of self-trusting scholars:</p> <p>Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with these,&#x2014;but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and turn drudges, or die of disgust.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career, do not yet see, that, if the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience,&#x2014;patience;&#x2014;with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace, the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work, the study and the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds.20</p> <p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was in attendance for this &#x201c;grand Oration,&#x201d; called it &#x201c;our intellectual Declaration of Independence&#x201d; and witnessed young men leaving the hall as if a prophet had spoken to them.21 </p> <p>Emerson was a writer and lecturer of note, an orator who could inspire and change opinions, but he could also instigate controversy, in particular with his &#x201c;An Address to the Senior Class in Divinity College, Cambridge,&#x201d; the following year. Created from his decade-long interest in the German higher criticism that treated the Bible as a group of literary texts deserving critical study of their origins and analysis of their literary history rather than as revealed or inspired texts deserving blind faith, as well as from Emerson&#x2019;s strong belief in the divinity within, his address should have surprised no one. Nonetheless, it was branded as &#x201c;the latest form of infidelity&#x201d;22 by one of the leading Unitarians, Andrews Norton, and Emerson would not be invited back to speak at Harvard for nearly three decades.</p> <p>Whether a prophet or an infidel, Emerson was in demand as a lecturer, and his lecture tours supplemented the monies he received from his first wife&#x2019;s estate. In early 1834, while preaching in Plymouth, Emerson met Lydia Jackson, who would be called Lidian, and sometimes Queenie or Asia, by her future husband. They married the following year, lived at Bush, Emerson&#x2019;s new home in Concord, and raised four children&#x2014;two sons, two daughters&#x2014;although their first, Waldo, died from scarlatina at the age of five. Theirs was a love of &#x201c;sober joy,&#x201d;23 which contrasted deeply with the youthful and passionate love Emerson had had for Ellen, whose memory lived on with them indelibly at Bush when their first daughter was named for her.</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;</p> <p>Just as Thoreau remarked that he lived in &#x201c;two worlds&#x2014;the post-office &amp; Nature,&#x201d;24 and that it was the juxtaposition of these two worlds that created the sphere in which he lived, Emerson was aware that it was the pull of two worlds and the struggle of balancing them both&#x2014;&#x201c;angelic insight alternating with bestial activity: sage and tiger&#x201d;25&#x2014;that made a whole. It lay him open to charges of inconsistency or insincerity with which he wrestled but ultimately accepted.</p> <p>I am nominally a believer: yet I hold on to property: I eat my bread with unbelief. I approve every wild action of the experimenters. I say what they say concerning celibacy or money or community of goods and my only apology for not doing their work is preoccupation of mind. I have a work of my own which I know I can do with some success. It would leave that undone if I should undertake with them and I do not see in myself any vigour equal to such an enterprise. My Genius loudly calls me to stay where I am, even with the degradation of owning bank-stock and seeing poor men suffer whilst the Universal Genius apprises me of this disgrace &amp; beckons me to the martyr&#x2019;s and redeemer&#x2019;s office.26</p> <p>As both society and nature made a complete universe, and not one against the other but one in conjunction with the other, so, too, Emerson was aware that there were different plains for the intellect to travel, but that it was the &#x201c;binding old and new to some purpose&#x201d;27 that created something unlimited and enduring.</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1836 a group of original thinkers was drawn together by the affinity of their ideas. Their meetings were nicknamed the Transcendental Club by their critics. They thought of themselves simply as like-minded.</p> <p>Transcendentalism was a literary and reform movement that was not a movement, a religion that was not a religion, a circle that had no center and no circumference. It is due to this lack of consensus as to what it is that makes it both difficult and simple to define. Although Emerson said that the &#x201c;field cannot be well seen from within the field,&#x201d;28 it still may be the best perspective from which to look at what Transcendentalism was. On December 23, 1841, Emerson read a lecture on it, &#x201c;The Transcendentalist,&#x201d; at the Masonic Temple in Boston. It began:</p> <p>The first thing we have to say respecting what are called <i>new views</i> here in New England, at the present time, is, that they are not new, but the very oldest of thoughts cast into the mold of these new times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What is popularly called Transcendentalism among us, is Idealism; Idealism as it appears in 1842. As thinkers, mankind have ever divided into two sects, Materialists and Idealists; the first class founding on experience, the second on consciousness; the first class beginning to think from the data of the s...</p></p><h2>Early Modern England: A Social History 1550-1760 (Hodder Arnold Publication)</h2><p><p><i>Early Modern England,</i> first published two decades ago, and recently updated, is one of the most widely used texts in this area of subject study.

Ramsay</b> was a Presbyterian minister who taught for many years at Bethel College inMcKenzie, Tennessee. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Westminster Guide to the Books of the Bible</i> and <i>II Corinthians</i> in the Interpretation Bible Studies series, both published by WJK.With this volume, Ramsay (religion, Bethel Coll.) has updated his Layman's Guide to the New Testament (Westminster/John Knox, 1980), adding sections on the Old Testament and Apocrypha and using the New Revised Standard Version as his text. Three concerns drive his explication: What does the book or passage say? What did it mean when written? What does it mean today? Ramsay handles the first two questions adroitly and wisely avoids sermonizing on the third. His facility with historical and textual criticism is admirable and his honesty regarding the books' value is refreshing. By frequently using the latest archaeological finds, he invites the reader deeper into the text, and his style is so natural that even such reputedly "dry" books as Leviticus and Numbers come to life.

Across this vast terrain, James Kornwolf conjures the outlines of the constructed environment as it emerged in settlements and communities, in structures and sites, and in the flourishes and idiosyncrasies of the families and individuals who erected and inhabited colonial buildings and towns. Here as never before readers can observe the impulses and principles of colonial design and planning as they are implemented in the buildings and streets, harbors and squares, gardens and landscapes of the New World.</p><p>Incorporating more than 3,000 illustrations, Kornwolf's massive work conveys the full range of the colonial encounter with the continent's geography, from the high forms of architecture through formal landscape design and town planning. From these pages emerge the fine arts of environmental design, an understanding of the political and economic events that helped to determine settlement in North America, an appreciation of the various architectural and landscape forms that the settlers created, and an awareness of the diversity of the continent's geography and its peoples. Considering the humblest buildings along with the mansions of the wealthy and powerful, public buildings, forts, and churches, Kornwolf captures the true dynamism and diversity of colonial communities&#x2015;their rivalries and frictions, their outlooks and attitudes&#x2015;as they extended their hold on the land. His work conveys for the first time the full scale, from intimate to grand, of their enduring transformation of the natural landscape of North America. </p></p><p><p><b>James D.

Despite its themes of waylaid hopes and lost innocence, this semiautobiographical coming-of-age novel revels in small pleasures and the colorful language of its time and place.</p><p><b>Truman Capote </b>was born September 30, 1924, in New Orleans. After his parents&#x2019; divorce, he was sent to live with relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. It was here he would meet his lifelong friend, the author Harper Lee. Capote rose to international prominence in 1948 with the publication of his debut novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms. Among his celebrated works are <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s, A Tree of Night, The Grass Harp, Summer Crossing, A Christmas Memory,</i> and <i>In Cold Blood,</i> widely considered one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. Twice awarded the O. Henry Short Story Prize, Capote was also the recipient of a National Institute of Arts and Letters Creative Writing Award and an Edgar Award. He died August 25, 1984, shortly before his sixtieth birthday.Truman Capote<br> Breakfast at Tiffany's &amp; Other Voices, Other Rooms<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> I am always drawn back to places where I have lived, the houses and their neighborhoods. For instance, there is a brownstone in the East Seventies where, during the early years of the war, I had my first New York apartment. It was one room crowded with attic furniture, a sofa and fat chairs upholstered in that itchy, particular red velvet that one associates with hot days on a train. The walls were stucco, and a color rather like tobacco-spit. Everywhere, in the bathroom too, there were prints of Roman ruins freckled brown with age. The single window looked out on a fire escape. Even so, my spirits heightened whenever I felt in my pocket the key to this apartment; with all its gloom, it still was a place of my own, the first, and my books were there, and jars of pencils to sharpen, everything I needed, so I felt, to become the writer I wanted to be.<br> It never occurred to me in those days to write about Holly Golightly, and probably it would not now except for a conversation I had with Joe Bell that set the whole memory of her in motion again.<br> Holly Golightly had been a tenant in the old brownstone; she&#x2019;d occupied the apartment below mine. As for Joe Bell, he ran a bar around the corner on Lexington Avenue; he still does.<br> Both Holly and I used to go there six, seven times a day, not for a drink, not always, but to make telephone calls: during the war a private telephone was hard to come by. Moreover, Joe Bell was good about taking messages, which in Holly&#x2019;s case was no small favor, for she had a tremendous many.<br> Of course this was a long time ago, and until last week I hadn&#x2019;t seen Joe Bell in several years. Off and on we&#x2019;d kept in touch, and occasionally I&#x2019;d stopped by his bar when passing through the neighborhood; but actually we&#x2019;d never been strong friends except in as much as we were both friends of Holly Golightly. Joe Bell hasn&#x2019;t an easy nature, he admits it himself, he says it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s a bachelor and has a sour stomach. Anyone who knows him will tell you he&#x2019;s a hard man to talk to. Impossible if you don&#x2019;t share his fixations, of which Holly is one. Some others are: ice hockey, Weimaraner dogs, Our Gal Sunday (a soap serial he has listened to for fifteen years), and Gilbert and Sullivan&#x2014;he claims to be related to one or the other, I can&#x2019;t remember which.<br> And so when, late last Tuesday afternoon, the telephone rang and I heard &#x201c;Joe Bell here,&#x201d; I knew it must be about Holly. He didn&#x2019;t say so, just: &#x201c;Can you rattle right over here? It&#x2019;s -important,&#x201d; and there was a croak of excitement in his froggy voice.<br> I took a taxi in a downpour of October rain, and on my way I even thought she might be there, that I would see Holly again.<br> But there was no one on the premises except the proprietor. Joe Bell&#x2019;s is a quiet place compared to most Lexington Avenue bars. It boasts neither neon nor television. Two old mirrors reflect the weather from the streets; and behind the bar, in a niche surrounded by photographs of ice-hockey stars, there is always a large bowl of fresh flowers that Joe Bell himself arranges with matronly care. That is what he was doing when I came in.<br> &#x201c;Naturally,&#x201d; he said, rooting a gladiola deep into the bowl, &#x201c;naturally I wouldn&#x2019;t have got you over here if it wasn&#x2019;t I wanted your opinion. It&#x2019;s peculiar. A very peculiar thing has happened.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You heard from Holly?&#x201d;<br> He fingered a leaf, as though uncertain of how to answer. A small man with a fine head of coarse white hair, he has a bony, sloping face better suited to someone far taller; his complexion seems permanently sunburned: now it grew even redder. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say exactly heard from her. I mean, I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s why I want your opinion. Let me build you a drink. Something new. They call it a White Angel,&#x201d; he said, mixing one-half vodka, one-half gin, no vermouth. While I drank the result, Joe Bell stood sucking on a Tums and turning over in his mind what he had to tell me. Then: &#x201c;You recall a certain Mr. I.&nbsp;Y. Yunioshi? A gentleman from Japan.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;From California,&#x201d; I said, recalling Mr. Yunioshi perfectly. He&#x2019;s a photographer on one of the picture magazines, and when I knew him he lived in the studio apartment on the top floor of the brownstone.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go mixing me up. All I&#x2019;m asking, you know who I mean? Okay. So last night who comes waltzing in here but this selfsame Mr. I.&nbsp;Y. Yunioshi. I haven&#x2019;t seen him, I guess it&#x2019;s over two years. And where do you think he&#x2019;s been those two years?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Africa.&#x201d;<br> Joe Bell stopped crunching on his Tums, his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;So how did you know?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Read it in Winchell.&#x201d; Which I had, as a matter of fact.<br> He rang open his cash register, and produced a manila envelope. &#x201c;Well, see did you read this in Winchell.&#x201d;<br> In the envelope were three photographs, more or less the same, though taken from different angles: a tall delicate Negro man wearing a calico skirt and with a shy, yet vain smile, displaying in his hands an odd wood sculpture, an elongated carving of a head, a girl&#x2019;s, her hair sleek and short as a young man&#x2019;s, her smooth wood eyes too large and tilted in the tapering face, her mouth wide, overdrawn, not unlike clown-lips. On a glance it resembled most primitive carving; and then it didn&#x2019;t, for here was the spit-image of Holly Golightly, at least as much of a likeness as a dark still thing could be.<br> &#x201c;Now what do you make of that?&#x201d; said Joe Bell, satisfied with my puzzlement.<br> &#x201c;It looks like her.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Listen, boy,&#x201d; and he slapped his hand on the bar, &#x201c;it is her. Sure as I&#x2019;m a man fit to wear britches. The little Jap knew it was her the minute he saw her.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He saw her? In Africa?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well. Just the statue there. But it comes to the same thing. Read the facts for yourself,&#x201d; he said, turning over one of the photographs. On the reverse was written: Wood Carving, <br> S Tribe, Tococul, East Anglia, Christmas Day, 1956.<br> He said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what the Jap says,&#x201d; and the story was this: On Christmas day Mr. Yunioshi had passed with his camera through Tococul, a village in the tangles of nowhere and of no interest, merely a congregation of mud huts with monkeys in the yards and buzzards on the roofs. He&#x2019;d decided to move on when he saw suddenly a Negro squatting in a doorway carving monkeys on a walking stick. Mr. Yunioshi was impressed and asked to see more of his work. Whereupon he was shown the carving of the girl&#x2019;s head: and felt, so he told Joe Bell, as if he were falling in a dream. But when he offered to buy it the Negro cupped his private parts in his hand (apparently a tender gesture, comparable to tapping one&#x2019;s heart) and said no. A pound of salt and ten dollars, a wristwatch and two pounds of salt and twenty dollars, nothing swayed him. Mr. Yunioshi was in all events determined to learn how the carving came to be made. It cost him his salt and his watch, and the incident was conveyed in African and pig-English and finger-talk. But it would seem that in the spring of that year a party of three white persons had appeared out of the brush riding horseback. A young woman and two men. The men, both red-eyed with fever, were forced for several weeks to stay shut and shivering in an isolated hut, while the young woman, having presently taken a fancy to the woodcarver, shared the woodcarver&#x2019;s mat.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t credit that part,&#x201d; Joe Bell said squeamishly. &#x201c;I know she had her ways, but I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d be up to anything as much as that.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And then?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then nothing,&#x201d; he shrugged. &#x201c;By and by she went like she come, rode away on a horse.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Alone, or with the two men?&#x201d;<br> Joe Bell blinked. &#x201c;With the two men, I guess. Now the Jap, he asked about her up and down the country. But nobody else had ever seen her.&#x201d; Then it was as if he could feel my own sense of letdown transmitting itself to him, and he wanted no part of it. &#x201c;One thing you got to admit, it&#x2019;s the only definite news in I don&#x2019;t know how many&#x201d;&#x2014; he counted on his fingers: there weren&#x2019;t enough&#x2014; &#x201c;years. All I hope, I hope she&#x2019;s rich. She must be rich. You got to be rich to go mucking around in Africa.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s probably never set foot in Africa,&#x201d; I said, believing it; yet I could see her there, it was somewhere she would have gone. And the carved head: I looked at the photographs again.<br> &#x201c;You know so much, where is she?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Dead. Or in a crazy house. Or married. I think she&#x2019;s married and quieted down and maybe right in this very city.&#x201d;<br> He considered a moment. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, and shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you why. If she was in this city I&#x2019;d have seen her. You take a man that likes to walk, a man like me, a man&#x2019;s been walking in the streets going on ten or twelve years, and all those years he&#x2019;s got his eye out for one person, and nobody&#x2019;s ever her, don&#x2019;t it stand to reason she&#x2019;s not there? I see pieces of her all the time, a flat little bottom, any skinny girl that walks fast and straight&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused, as though too aware of how intently I was looking at him. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m round the bend?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I didn&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;d been in love with her. Not like that.&#x201d;<br> I was sorry I&#x2019;d said it; it disconcerted him. He scooped up the photographs and put them back in their envelope. I looked at my watch. I hadn&#x2019;t any place to go, but I thought it was better to leave.<br> &#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; he said, gripping my wrist. &#x201c;Sure I loved her. But it wasn&#x2019;t that I wanted to touch her.&#x201d; And he added, without smiling: &#x201c;Not that I don&#x2019;t think about that side of things. Even at my age, and I&#x2019;ll be sixty-seven January ten. It&#x2019;s a peculiar fact&#x2014;but, the older I grow, that side of things seems to be on my mind more and more. I don&#x2019;t remember thinking about it so much even when I was a youngster and it&#x2019;s every other minute. Maybe the older you grow and the less easy it is to put thought into action, maybe that&#x2019;s why it gets all locked up in your head and becomes a burden. Whenever I read in the paper about an old man disgracing himself, I know it&#x2019;s because of this burden. But&#x201d;&#x2014;he poured himself a jigger of whiskey and swallowed it neat&#x2014; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never disgrace myself. And I swear, it never crossed my mind about Holly. You can love somebody without it being like that. You keep them a stranger, a stranger who&#x2019;s a friend.&#x201d;<br> Two men came into the bar, and it seemed the moment to leave. Joe Bell followed me to the door. He caught my wrist again. &#x201c;Do you believe it?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That you didn&#x2019;t want to touch her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I mean about Africa.&#x201d;<br> At that moment I couldn&#x2019;t seem to remember the story, <br> only the image of her riding away on a horse. &#x201c;Anyway, she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, opening the door. &#x201c;Just gone.&#x201d;<br> Outside, the rain had stopped, there was only a mist of it in the air, so I turned the corner and walked along the street where the brownstone stands. It is a street with trees that in the summer make cool patterns on the pavement; but now the leaves were yellowed and mostly down, and the rain had made them slippery, they skidded underfoot. The brownstone is midway in the block, next to a church where a blue tower-clock tolls the hours. It has been sleeked up since my day; a smart black door has replaced the old frosted glass, and gray elegant shutters frame the windows. No one I remember still lives there except Madame Sapphia Spanella, a husky coloratura who every afternoon went roller-skating in Central Park. I know she&#x2019;s still there because I went up the steps and looked at the mailboxes. It was one of these mailboxes that had first made me aware of Holly Golightly.</p><h2>Three Men in a Boat (Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading): (To Say Nothing of the Dog!)</h2><p>This comic classic, first published in 1889, is one of the most widely read and beloved works of British fiction.

"I have been told," Welty writes in the introduction, "both in approval and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters." The characters that spring to life in this masterwork reveal the depth and breadth of her love. <br>"Miss Welty's short stories are deceptively simple. They are concerned with ordinary people, but what happens to them and the manner of the telling are far from ordinary . . . A fine writer and a distinguished book.

The period had started with the partition of Poland and the absorption of its territories into the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires; it would end with the first large-scale outbreaks of anti-Semitic violence and the imposition in Russia of strong anti-Semitic legislation. In the years between, a traditional society accustomed to an autonomous way of life would be transformed into one much more open to its surrounding cultures, yet much more confident of its own nationalist identity. In <i>The Jews of Eastern Europe</i>, Israel Bartal traces this transformation and finds in it the roots of Jewish modernity.</p></p><p><b>Israel Bartal</b> is Avraham Harman Chair in Jewish History at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Among his books are <i>The Records of the Council of the Four Lands, Volume 1: 1580-1792</i>, <i>Exile in the Homeland</i>, and <i>Poles and Jews: A Failed Brotherhood</i> (with Magdalena Opalski).<p>Introduction</p><p>The following chapters relate the history of East European Jewry from the time of the Polish partitions at the end of the eighteenth century to the pogroms that broke out in the southern regions of the Russian empire in the early 1880s. In the summer of 1772, the three neighbors of the Polish state tore off large chunks of her territory, embarking on a process that, within a little less than two decades, led to Poland's demise as an independent political entity. The first partition of Poland was also the beginning of the triple encounter of the Jews of the Polish Commonwealth with the Austrian bureaucracy (in Galicia), the Russian officialdom (in White Russia) and the Prussian administration (in western Prussia). This encounter between a populous Jewish community, with an age-old cultural tradition, and the apparatus of the centralized state was, for the Polish Jew, the commencement of the modern era. And since the Jews residing in the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom formed an absolute majority of European Jewry The first partition of Poland can actually be viewed as the commencement of the modern era in Jewish history as a whole. Moreover, from then on, a mass immigration movement began that greatly increased the number of Polish Jews in other parts of Europe.</p><p>From 1772, a complex and multifaceted process of integration and acculturation started in the regions severed from the Polish state. The Polish-Lithuanian Jew became a "Russian Jew," a "German Jew," or an "Austrian Jew." This was not a rapid process. Most of the Jews in the areas annexed from Poland to the neighboring states continued to maintain their old way of life for decades after they were no longer subjects of the Polish king. They regarded themselves as "Polish Jews," and that is how they were seen by German, Austrian and Russian writers and bureaucrats. As far back as the 1860s, the Yiddish writer Isaac Yoel Linetzky called the protagonist of his anti-Hasidic satire "<i>Dos Poylishe Yingl</i>" (The Polish Lad), although he depicted him as a Jew living in Ukraine, deep inside the territory of the Russian empire. Jewish socialists who published a Yiddish newspaper in London intended for the masses of poor immigrants from the Russian empire, called it (in 1884!) <i>Der Poylisher Yidl</i> (The Polish Kike). According to one of the editors, they chose this name because they wanted to voice the immigrants' protest against the disdainful attitude adopted towards them by the English Jews, who were panic-stricken by the idea that "the Poles are coming!" In those very same years, the German historian, Heinrich von Treitschke, in a polemic with the Jewish historian, Heinrich Graetz, expressed his fear that the German Reich would be inundated by masses of Polish Jewish immigrants. In Treitschke's view, the fact that these immigrants clung to their national identity was antithetical to the equal political rights they had recently been granted. Moreover, it constituted a real threat to the German character of his country. More than one hundred years, then, after the first Polish partition, the Jews of Eastern Europe were still seen by many as a community that had preserved its "Polishness." And deep into the modern era, they maintained what Gershon Hundert recently described as a positive sense of Jewish "identity."</p><p>However, what began as the invasions by Poland's enemies in the last decades of the eighteenth century nonetheless changed the political base of the traditional society's life. Although the masses of Jews underwent only partial integration, some segments of the population were considerably influenced by it. The processes of acculturation did not cause the old Jewish culture to disappear, but they did augment it with cultural traits previously unknown to the Jews of the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom. The changes that affected East European Jewry in the nineteenth century also gave rise to a new type of antagonism between them and the various ethnic groups in the empires. The old religious conflict, between Catholics and Jews as well as between the Eastern Orthodox and the Jews, took the form of a radical anti-Semitism, in which the influence of national Romanticism merged with messianic revolutionism In March 1881, 111 years after the Russian army entered the towns of White Russia, Tsar Alexander II was mortally wounded by assassins belonging to the revolutionary movement. Six weeks after the Tsar's murder, the southern provinces of the Russian empire were swept by waves of pogroms against the Jews, unparalleled in their duration and geographical spread. In their wake, many Jews, during the pogroms or in the years soon after, began to abandon the option of integration and acculturation in favor of more radical solutions to the problems of their economic, social and spiritual existence. "The Russian Jew," like his brethren on the Austrian side of the border, began to exchange the incomplete imperial identity, which had taken shape after the Polish partitions, for alternative identities, either by emigrating to new lands or by seeking new Jewish identities unprecedented in the history of East European Jewry.</p><p>The boundaries of historical periods are clearly determined by subjective considerations. On the basis of their ideologies, political interests, a certain geographical link or ethnic identity, people are liable to draw totally disparate time lines. The sociologist Eviatar Zerubavel states that:</p><blockquote>There are many alternative ways to cut up the past, none of which are more natural and hence more valid then others. Any system of periodization is thus inevitably social, since our ability to envision the historical watersheds separating one conventional "period" from another is basically a product of being socialized in specific <i>traditions</i> of carving up the past. In other words, we need to be mnemonically <i>socialized</i> to regard certain historical events as significant "turning points."</blockquote>Indeed, why should we decide that the partitions of Poland constitute an historical turning point in the history of East European Jewry? After all, one of the major claims I put forward in this book is that many of the social, economic and cultural traits that were hallmarks of the link between the Polish feudal system and the Jews continued to exist for many years after 1772. Life in the towns of Galicia or White Russia did not change much until the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1850 very few Jews in the Russian Pale of Settlement or in Austrian Galicia felt at home in the cultures of the state. This was the time when the Hasidic movement, a consummate product of the traditional culture, was crossing the borders of empires and winning the hearts of Jews throughout Eastern Europe. Similarly, one can ask whether the year 1881 marks a turning point in the history of East European Jewry. Zionist historiography, on the one hand, and the historical research written under the influence of Jewish radicalism, on the other, chose the year of the pogroms as the time when a new era opened in Jewish history. In 1969, the national-radical historian, Shmuel Ettinger (1919-1988) wrote:<blockquote>There has been no more dramatic period in Jewish history than the years between 1881 and 1948&#x2014;a relatively short span of time when measured against the annals of a nation. During those years the Jewish people underwent enormous changes and agonizing tribulations. Yet, at the same time, manifested an extraordinary vitality. [ . . . ] In contrast to the lengthy tradition developed during the Middle Ages to divert the resentment of alien rule and the sufferings of the Diaspora into the inner world of the spirit and abstain from political activism [ . . . ] mighty forces now awoke in the people. These forces, operating at a social and political level, transformed a scattered, divided, and mortally wounded people from a passive entity into an active and independent political and social force.</blockquote>Ettinger was a Jewish-Russian intellectual, who, in his political and cultural life, moved from a Hasidic ultraorthodox home in Ukraine to Marxism-Leninism in Palestine under the British mandate, and then became an ardent Socialist Zionist in the State of Israel. As for many intellectuals from Eastern Europe, for him too, the image of the Jewish past became a dynamic product of a changing world-view. In his transition from Communism to nationalism, Ettinger altered the role of 1881 in his historical thinking. In an earlier version of his lectures on modern Jewish history (from which his previously cited work was adapted), 1848&#x2014;the year of the "spring of the nations"&#x2014;was a watershed in modern Jewish history. Jonathan Frankel also describes what took place in the year of the pogroms as a radical and unprecedented shift. In his monumental work on the roots of modern Jewish politics, describing events in the wake of the pogroms, he states that "a revolution in modern Jewish politics took place in Russia during the years 1881-1882." In recent years, there has been a tendency in research on the history of East European Jewry to place less emphasis on the influence of the pogroms on the processes of modernization the Jewish people underwent in the modern era. Unquestionably, the decline of the political movements, which, in previous generations, had shaped the collective memory of the past of United States and Israeli Jewry, contributed to a new way of looking at the role of 1881 in Jewish history. That year was linked in the Jewish collective memory with the emergence of the <i>Hibbat Zion</i> movement, as well as with the search for the roots of the mass immigration to the United States. Modern nationalism and the mass immigration were two modes of reaction to the pogroms that distanced the Jews from the old country. They blackened the memory of the past and radicalized trends that until then had not been unequivocal in the complex historical reality. Even after the 1881-1882 pogroms, certain sectors in Jewish society still tended to seek integration into the imperial cultures. Jewish-Russian culture, works by Jewish authors in the Polish language and aspirations for social and political integration continued to exist alongside trends of separatism and abandonment. At times, these conflicting trends were even intermixed, because Jewish nationalism in Eastern Europe was strongly influenced by the cultures into which many Jews aspired to integrate.<p></p><p>In his groundbreaking research, Benjamin Nathans adopted a Tocquevillian reenvisioning that "seeks not to deny the profound upheaval that occurred in Russian Jewry (just as Tocqueville never denied that a revolution occurred in France in 1789) but rather to reveal the subtle forms of change as well as continuities that bridge the moment of crisis."</p><p>In this book, I tend to concur with some of these reservations about the view that the events of 1881 caused a revolutionary "leap" from a premodern phase in the history of East European Jewry to a totally new phase. Thus, for example, I stress the fact that some Jewish intellectuals in the Russian empire were already becoming disillusioned with the policy of the imperial government towards Jews quite a few years before the pogroms, and this suggests that there was not a sudden shift in the attitude of the members of the Haskalah movement towards the Russian government. Moreover, in this book, I assert that the disintegration of the feudal system, which preceded the pogroms of the eighties, was a decisive factor in the profound upheaval that Jewish society underwent. The pogroms in the Pale of Settlement were, in a certain sense, a byproduct of political, economic and social processes rather than a major cause of these processes.</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe the 1881 pogroms can be viewed as a significant milestone in the history of East European Jewry. The Jews' tendency to isolate themselves from the milieu in which they had lived for centuries was then significantly intensified and took on massive proportions. Anti-Semitism became an official policy in the Russian empire and Jewish nationalism moved from its cultural phase to the phase of political organization. Although the massive immigration from Eastern Europe to the West began back in the seventies because of the famine that struck the northern provinces of the Pale of Settlement, it became associated with the new anti-Semitism. From then on, it was also linked to the emergence of a nationalist movement that sought to direct the huge stream of immigrants into different ideological channels.</p><p>The period 1772-1881 constitutes a vastly significant chapter in the history of the largest Jewish collective in the world in modern times. During those years, a society, immense in its demographic dimensions, spread over a large geographical area on the eastern fringes of Europe, underwent processes of change that uprooted and shattered centuries-old social and cultural structures and practices, exposing the Jews to the transformative power of modernity. In the one hundred years described in the following chapters, historical circumstances arose that engendered the development of large Jewish movements, which later determined the nature of contemporary Jewish society, left their imprint on contemporary Jewish collectives, and also played a decisive role in shaping Israeli society. From 1772-1881, the founders of the Haskalah movement in Lithuania and Ukraine made their appearance; the first buds of secular Hebrew literature emerged; the first modern works in Yiddish, the spoken language of the Jewish masses, were written; Jewish literature in Polish and Russian was created; and the Jewish press in various languages flourished. Also, during that period, the founders of the Jewish national movement; the early leaders of East European Orthodoxy, and the pioneers of the Jewish labor movement, were galvanized into action. All of these movements bore the hallmark of Eastern Europe: a blend of an ethnic Jewish identity, deeply rooted in a large, widespread community, with a profound consciousness of modernity. Even the opponents of modernity, including the rabbis of Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century, were greatly influenced by it. They understood all too well that the <i>kahal</i> with its rabbis and laymen leaders, had ceased to exist, and they adjusted to modern politics and to concepts such as public opinion, equal rights, and nationalism. The radical revolutionaries and the early nationalists, on the other hand, while they cherished the vision of revolution and change, still felt part of that large community of Jews rooted in their culture. They rediscovered this community, felt connected to it and wanted to preserve some parts of its culture. The history of the two large Jewish centers in the world&#x2014;Israel and the United States&#x2014;is not linked only due to the simple demographic fact that several million Jews in the Middle East and in North America are the offspring of East European immigrants. In my view, it is impossible to understand political and social processes and to delve deeply into cultural phenomena in the State of Israel without a profound knowledge of what took place in Eastern Europe in the decades prior to the period of the First Aliya. We usually seek historical explanations for what was created in the Land of Israel in the last 120 years in the Middle East...</p></p><h2>Every Bride Is Beautiful: The Complete Guide To Wedding Beauty From Head To Toe</h2><p>For the three million American women who tie the knot each year, <em>Every Bride Is Beautiful</em> explains -- in words, crisp photographs, and illustrations -- how easy it is to achieve elegance, glamour, and the perfect peronal look for the big day.<p>With inside advice from the pros who plan America's A list weddings, beuaty expert Deborah Chase covers every aspect of bridal beauty including:</p><p>How to choose the wedding style that is most appropriate for your personal taste -- and budget. <br>The perfect diet to lose weight and keep it off -- easily and safely.<br>How to find the most flattering gown among the maze of choices.<br>How to coordinate the acessories, makeup, nails, and hairstyle that best fit the wedding's special look.</p><p>The key to being a beautiful bride, Chase says, is comfort and confidence -- and that means doing what's right for you -- not just copying the latest trend.

While Paski tries to concentrate on mountain biking and not thinking too much about ultra-hot Chris Cabrera, she is troubled by the beautiful and wicked Jessica Nguyen. Jessica is the queen of the haters and she's got her eye on Paski. <br></p><p>Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez is the New York Times bestselling author of The Dirty Girls Social Club and Playing with Boys. She is an award-winning print and broadcast journalist and a former staff writer for both the Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe. She is currently writing and co-producing the upcoming Lifetime TV series adaptation of The Dirty Girls Social Club. Haters is her first young adult novel.<br>Grade 9 Up&#x2013;When her counter-culture artist dad makes a film deal for his comic strip, 16-year-old Paski moves from comfy Taos, NM, to Orange County, CA. Her down-to-earth lifestyle hasn't prepared her for the pace of money-conscious southern California, or for the perfect-looking, incredibly wealthy teenagers who rule the school. Here, she is discriminated against not for being Mexican American, but for her digs (a luxury apartment). During a raucous party, her escort slips a date-rape drug in her soda, and she is pushed into the pool by beautiful, popular, and unflinchingly ruthless Jessica, resulting in a hospital visit. Still, Paski can't ignore the sizzling attraction she feels toward Jessica's boyfriend or the persistent visions (it's the family gift) that she's been having of Jessica wiping out during a motocross race. Valdes-Rodriguez includes all of the snarky hip commentary and girl-friend focus that defined her titles for adults, packing in explicit descriptions of clothing, home d�cor, and sex. Paski's first-person narrative is lively and honest, as she faces difficult situations and learns to trust her instincts. Her relationship with her permissive, doting father is described with humor and warmth. Basically, this is a chick-lit version of magical realism, as Paski, the golden Latina, uses her fabulous good looks, super mountain-biking skills, and psychic visions to arrive at the top of the heap.<i>&#x2013;Carol A.

Wolf, a professor of nursing, identifies four fundamental ritualspostmortem procedures, administering medication, asceptic practices, and change-of-shift reportsand how these arts are learned and practiced in a large urban hospital. The first three rituals focus on the patient, the nurse's primary responsibility. The change-of-shift report functions as an orderly transfer of responsibility from one nurse to another. Wolf details nurses' performance and attitude in the execution of these duties, but does not explore the origins and purpose of these rituals.

Her messages about math have reached teachers through her many books, videotapes, articles and talks, as well as her extensive program of Math Solutions courses. A former classroom teacher, Marilyn is the recipient of many awards, including the Glenn Gilbert National Leadership Award from the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics and the Louise Hay Award for Contributions to Mathematics from the Association for Women in Mathematics.This book is a great resource for teachers. It provides essential information to help teachers understand how children learn mathematics. This book is a nice companion to NCTM s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. It also gives background information and student activities that go hand in hand with Principles and Standards. I read the first edition of Burns s book many years ago, but I still find it to be energizing because it speaks to the soul of teachers who believe that mathematics is more than 2 + 3 = 5. Author Marilyn Burns is synonymous with problem solving. She has been, and continues to be, a leader in the world of mathematics. The book is divided into four parts: Raising the Issues, Problem-Solving Activities in the Strands, Teaching Arithmetic, and Mathematical Discussions. A bibliography, blackline masters, and a list of activities compliment this book. Each part contains a great deal of information and numerous activities for kindergarten through eighth grade. It is a true teacher s resource. Part 1&#39;s background information helps readers better understand mathematics education. It is very insightful and makes valuable suggestions for answering tough questions concerning the how of mathematics, such as how mathematics is being taught compared with how it was once taught. Part 3 includes a section on extending multiplication and division that was not in the first edition. Part 4 is entirely new and not to be missed. The activities presented in this book require the students to use the NCTM s Process Standards. Some classic problem-solving activities can be found, such as If a = $.01, b = $.02, . . . , what is the value of your name? and the classic handshake problem. The first-year teacher or the veteran teacher can find this book to be beneficial. The activities are not grade specific because they can be used in different grades. Learning is an ongoing process for both students and teachers, and this book will help both groups learn more about mathematics. I highly recommend it to teachers. --Review by Mary Lou Damjanovich from Teaching Children Mathematics, by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).

If there is a shortcut to this requirement, however, it is in reading about the experiences of others. Jack Schwager's book provides that shortcut.

These supertraders make millions of dollars-sometimes in hours-and consistently outperform their peers.<br> <br> As he did in his acclaimed national bestseller, Market Wizards, Jack Schwager interviews a host of these supertraders, spectacular winners whose success occurs across a spectrum of financial markets. These traders use different methods, but they all share an edge. How do they do it? What separates them from the others? What can they teach the average trader or investor?<br> <br> In The New Market Wizards, these wildly successful traders relate the financial strategies that have rocketed them to success, as well as the embarrassing losses that have proven them all too human.<br> <br> Meet the Wizards of Wall Street:<br> * Stan Druckenmiller, who, as manager of the Soros Quantum Fund, realized an average annual return of more than 38 percent on assets ranging between $2.0 and $3.5 billion<br> * William Eckhardt, a mathematician who, in collaboration with trader Richard Dennis, selected and trained the now-legendary circle known as the Turtles<br> * Bill Lipschutz, a former architect who, for eight years, was Salomon Brothers' largest and most successful currency trader<br> * Blair Hull, a one-time blackjack player who began an options trading company with<br> <br> Asking the questions that readers with an interest in the financial markets would love to pose to the financial superstars, and filled with candid appraisals, The New Market Wizards takes its place as a classic.</p><p><p><b><i>Taps into the minds of trading superstars to reveal the secrets of their astonishing success</i></b></p> <p>You may not know their names, but they are the trading elite&#x2014;a select group of super-moneymakers whose trading prowess has become the stuff of legend.

In this enthralling sequel to his international bestseller, <i>Market Wizards</i>, Jack Schwager interviews these stars, asking the questions that everyone with an interest in the financial markets would love to know the answers to and receiving the kind of frank, incisive answers that make this book as much a page-turner as its predecessor.</p> <p>In these absorbing interviews with star performers in the financial markets, Schwager humanizes the mechanics and psychology behind the trading world across a spectrum of financial markets including stocks, futures, currencies, and options by individuals, investment firms, and group-trading computerized "money machines." One trader focuses on market response to news events, another calculates mathematical probabilities&#x2014;one even cocks an ear to the noise level on the exchange floor. All rank assiduous research, self-confidence, a specific plan, and the courage to cut losses among essentials to success. None consider their trading gambling, but Schwager entertainingly argues that a successful trader needs many of the qualities of a good poker player.

Now there is: the second edition of this classic. M. Phyllis Lose, V.M.D., internationally respected for her knowledge and expertise in equine medicine, has revised and updated her book throughout to take into account the improvements and changes that have taken place in equine pediatrics since Brood Mares was first published. Here now is the latest information on drugs, medications and immunizations and an all-new chapter on difficult births (dystocia). Dr. Lose explains the problems that can arise and how you can safely intervene and safeguard the well-being of the mare until the veterinarian arrives. She says that "problems encountered at any time can be solved in almost every case, if the owner or caretaker will learn what to avoid, how to prevent mistakes, and most important, when to summon the veterinarian." Even those with years of experience can still learn from this book, with its seventy-five all-new photographs and drawings. Dr. Lose's language is technical enough not to insult the professional breeder, yet simple enough for the first-time breeder to grasp. She speaks with unmistakable authority but also with compassion for the mare. "Cows and women are tough," she says, "mares are delicate." The dual goals of a successful birth and a well-cared-for mare and foal are more likely to be achieved when you have this extraordinary book giving you all the help you're likely to need.The Howell Equestrian Library is a distinguished collection of books on all aspects of horsemanship and horsemastership.

Dickinson writes as she does both because she is steeped in the great patriarchal texts of her culture, from the Bible and hymns to Herbert&#x2019;s poetry and Emerson&#x2019;s prose, and because she is conscious of writing as a woman in an age and culture that assume great and serious poets are male.</p><p>Miller observes that Dickinson&#x2019;s language deviates from normal construction along definable and consistent lines; consequently it lends itself to the categorical analysis of an interpretive &#x201c;grammar&#x201d; such as the one she has constructed in this book. In order to facilitate the reading of Dickinson&#x2019;s poems and to reveal the values and assumptions behind the poet&#x2019;s manipulations of language, Miller examines in this grammar how specific elements of the poet&#x2019;s style tend to function in various contexts. Because many, especially modernist, poets use some of the same techniques, the grammar throws light on the poetic syntax of other writers as well.</p><p>In the course of her analysis, Miller draws not only on traditional historical and linguistic sources but also on current sociolinguistic studies of gender and speech and on feminist descriptions of women&#x2019;s writing. Dickinson&#x2019;s language, she concludes, could almost have been designed as a model for twentieth-century theories of what a women&#x2019;s language might be. As a critical examination of the relationship between linguistic style and literary identity in America&#x2019;s greatest woman poet, <i>Emily Dickinson: A Poet&#x2019;s Grammar</i> provides a significant addition to feminist literary studies.</p></p><p>Cristanne Miller is a SUNY Distinguished Professor and Edward H. Butler Professor of Literature at the University at Buffalo in New York.&#x201c;Cristanne Miller&#x2019;s study is...densely researched and...living and contemporary in its readings of the poems. Miller works from the assumption that Dickinson sees herself &#x2018;oppositionally, defining her position in the world negatively, by distance from some social construct or law&#x2019;. And Miller shows how those negations have a constructive role.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tom Paulin</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By returning us to fundamental issues of style, Miller focuses our attention on the relation between gender identity and literary creation... The accuracy of insight Miller brings to bear on Dickinson&#x2019;s &#x2018;cryptic revelations&#x2019; compels us to turn again to the poems to assess the revolutionary force of Dickinson&#x2019;s gender-inflected, elliptic grammar of disguise.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joanne Feit Diehl</b><b>, </b><b><i>Tulsa Studies in Women&#x2019;s Literature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Miller is such an exciting reader... Close and thoughtful interpretation is combined with good humor throughout [the book]... [It] is readable and often delightful. Like Dickinson herself, Miller is quietly full of surprise... Cristanne Miller discovers Dickinson &#x2018;in words (her own)&#x2019; (to use Adrienne Rich&#x2019;s phrase); she sees a self-conscious, determined, decisive Emily Dickinson, not someone so stricken with grief or pain or even her own sensitivity that she doesn&#x2019;t quite know what she&#x2019;s doing or what she&#x2019;s writing. Reminding us that Dickinson called her poems her &#x2018;letter to the World,&#x2019; Miller views the poems as communicative, not solipsistic, acts.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha Nell Smith</b><b>, </b><b><i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This grammar is neither too dry nor reductive nor abstract. Rather, it provides a way to organize Miller&#x2019;s insights into the particular moments and larger implications of Dickinson&#x2019;s art... Miller&#x2019;s understanding of Dickinson as a woman poet is especially convincing, especially compelling... A fine book: satisfying and stimulating.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Suzanne Juhasz</b><b>, </b><b><i>Legacy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Emily Dickinson: A Poet&#x2019;s Grammar</i> will be especially welcome...

Gilbert</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Literary Realism</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Miller shows readers what is actually at stake in this idiosyncratic verse and maps better than anyone to date the links between the grammatical choices and literary identity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Porter</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nineteenth-Century Literature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Reading this book makes one realize just how clumsy our approach to Dickinson&#x2019;s poetry has always been. Rather than casting about for specific referents for Dickinson&#x2019;s highly ambiguous references, Miller provides a method for understanding and appreciating the extraordinary suggestiveness of Dickinson&#x2019;s work...

Even before Elizabeth was crowned queen at the age of 25, her mother, Anne Boleyn, had been executed for treason by her father, King Henry VIII. She was then removed from the royal line of succession and later imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of plotting to overthrow her sister, Queen Mary. Yet despite all the challenges to her power, she became a hero of the Church of England in a century when Catholics and Protestants burned one another at the stake, she spoke five languages in a day when few women were taught to read, and she led a nation where men proclaimed that women had no right to take part in public life. During Elizabeth&#x2019;s 45-year reign, English literature, theater, music, and culture flourished. And, after her navy defeated the Spanish armada, England&#x2019;s military power made the once tiny kingdom into a chief player among Europe&#x2019;s nations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lively biography of one of England&#x2019;s greatest monarchs includes a time line, online resources, and 21 activities to offer readers hands-on experiences with life in the Elizabethan Era.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids can create costumes for the queen&#x2019;s court, including a knight&#x2019;s helmet, a neck ruff, and a cloak, play and sing a madrigal, create a 3-D map of an Elizabethan town, stitch a blackwork flower, design a family coat of arms, play a game of Nine Men&#x2019;s Morris, grow a knot garden, and much more.</p></p><p><strong>Kerrie Logan Hollihan is the author of <i>Isaac Newton and Physics for Kids</i> and <i>Theodore Roosevelt for Kids</i>, and has written for <i>Boy&#x2019;s Life</i> magazine and <i>Bird Watcher&#x2019;s Digest</i>. </strong>"Elizabeth I is a towering figure in both British and world history, and this book does a good job of explaining why . . .

At the same time, Buddhism had a profound effect on the material world of the Chinese. This wide-ranging study shows that Buddhism brought with it a vast array of objects big and small--relics treasured as parts of the body of the Buddha, prayer beads, and monastic clothing--as well as new ideas about what objects could do and how they should be treated. Kieschnick argues that even some everyday objects not ordinarily associated with Buddhism--bridges, tea, and the chair--on closer inspection turn out to have been intimately tied to Buddhist ideas and practices. Long after Buddhism ceased to be a major force in India, it continued to influence the development of material culture in China, as it does to the present day.</p><br><p> At first glance, this seems surprising. Many Buddhist scriptures and thinkers rejected the material world or even denied its existence with great enthusiasm and sophistication. Others, however, from Buddhist philosophers to ordinary devotees, embraced objects as a means of expressing religious sentiments and doctrines. What was a sad sign of compromise and decline for some was seen as strength and versatility by others. Yielding rich insights through its innovative analysis of particular types of objects, this briskly written book is the first to systematically examine the ambivalent relationship, in the Chinese context, between Buddhism and material culture.</p></p><p><p>"A remarkable achievement. By applying his Buddhological training to a topic typically ignored by Buddhologists, material objects, John Kieschnick has produced an original and groundbreaking book--the first of its kind not only in the area of Chinese Buddhism, but in the field of Buddhism writ large. There is simply nothing like this available in any Western language. Despite the technical nature of the subject, he manages to keep the scholarly apparatus unobtrusive. I would not hesitate to make it required reading in all of my upper level and graduate courses on Chinese Buddhism."<b>--Robert Sharf, University of Michigan</b></p><b>John Kieschnick</b> is an associate research fellow at the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, in Taipei.</p><h2>The Cave and the Cathedral: How a Real-Life Indiana Jones and a Renegade Scholar Decoded the Ancient Art of Man</h2><p><b>What Are The Ancients Trying To Tell Us?</b><p>"Why would the Cro-Magnon hunter-gatherers of Europe expend so much time and effort to penetrate into deep, dark, and dangerous caverns, where they might encounter cave bears and lions or get lost and die, aided only by the dim glow of animal fat�&#x20ac;&#x201c;burning stone candles, often crawling on all fours for distances of up to a mile or more underground . . . to paint amazing, haunting images of animals?"<br>�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<b>From <i>The Cave and the Cathedral</i></b></p><p>Join researcher and scientist Amir D.

There are few human figures and no trees, grass, or ground. The animals often overlap; two animals might share the same lines, for example, and at certain angles some appear three-dimensional. They are sometimes accompanied by symbols, dots, or, most riveting of all, imprints of human hands.</p><p>Who made these extraordinary drawings? How did the artists travel so far underground&#x2013;often into tunnels and chambers where they could not stand up? How did they make the drawings, when all they had for lighting were candles made of animal fat? Why did they draw them?</p><p>And what about the adventurers who discovered or charted these caves? French prehistorian Abb�&nbsp;Henri Breuil explored the cave at Rouffignac, France, in 1915, by crawling on all fours for <i>half a mile</i> inside to reach the deep gallery. There, he had to lie on his back to inspect and copy the drawings from the ceiling. In 1985, diver Henri Cosquer discovered the entrance to an underwater cave 120 feet deep in the Mediterranean near Marseilles and explored it for years without telling anyone, gradually swimming farther into the narrow shaft. Eventually, over 360 feet in, he was able to surface into the air of a large underground hall, covered with ancient art.</p><p>Unfolding like an Indiana Jones adventure, this book explores what the art might mean and our own development from the strikingly modern Cro-Magnons.</p><b>Amir D.

The Eighth Edition thoroughly analyzes 17 leading systems of psychotherapy and briefly surveys another 31, thereby providing a broader scope than is available in most books. The authors explore each system&#39;s theory of personality, theory of psychopathology, and resulting therapeutic process and therapy relationship. By doing so, they demonstrate how much psychotherapy systems agree on the processes producing change, while showing how they disagree on the content that needs to be changed. To bring these similarities and differences to life, the authors also present the limitations, practicalities, and outcome research of each system of psychotherapy.</p><p>James O.

Admirers of Montgomery&#x2019;s work will treasure this spirited anthology, while students of Canadian literature will reclaim with joy this long-lost part of our rich literary heritage.</p><p>In this heartwarming collection of nineteen short stories L.M. Montgomery returns to the enchanting shores of beautiful Prince Edward Island to tell about orphans much like Anne of Green Gables -- vulnerable, sensitive, and full of hope and courage. There&#39;s the lonely young girl on a quest for a real-life mother, a budding artist who dreams of fame and fortune, and old family quilt that unites two sisters with a long-lost relative, an ancient Egyptian doll that invokes an unusual spell for a little girl yearning for a special friend. L.M. Montgomery brings to life a magical place and a circle of characters who will long be treasured and remembered.<b>Lucy Maud Montgomery</b> was born in Clifton, Prince Edward Island, in 1874. Educated at Prince Edward College, Charlottetown, and Dalhousie University, she embarked on a career in teaching.

More autobiographical than the books about Anne is the trilogy of novels about another Island orphan, Emily Starr.<br><br>In 1911 Montgomery married the Rev. Ewan Macdonald, a Presbyterian clergyman, and they lived in Ontario, where he was the pastor of parishes in Leaskdale and, later, in Norval.

Situated in the deep interiors of Bastar, and inhabited by the Abujhmadias, a primitive hunter-gatherer tribe whom Verrier Elwin has called the Hill Murias, Abujhmad stands today as one of the few mirrors left the world over wherein modernity can view itself its calamities and collapses. Their dialect has no more than 300 to 500 words and they count only up to five. We do not need more than that, as they put it. The lone (home in their dialect) is not inside the hut. The hut is only a shelter for the night, against its elements, animals and spirits who roam it. We live in the outside; that is where our parentage and affections are centred, the say. They keep cows but never milk them. Brimming with many such singular insights into a fascinating way of life and based on the author s over thirty years of association with Abujhmad (he is probably the first outsider to live there) and its contiguous areas in the Bastar division of Chhattisgarh, Bastar Dispatches provides a compelling narrative of a people at peace with themselves and nature, their dialect, their festivities, their delightful interactions.</p><p>Narendra s association with tribal communities began in 1980 when he started living in the Abujhmad region of the Bastar division of Chhattisgarh under a field research programme. Later he continued staying in the contiguous areas and engaged in the thematics of conversations and expressions around the wilds and natural ecological cohesions in everyday living that sustain the Adivasi way of life. Some of his writings have been published by Dark Mountain (UK) and Chelsea Green Publishing (USA). Others have been published in Finnish. An anthology is soon to be brought out in Hindi and Marathi. He has delivered talks at various national and international fora.</p><h2>The Art and Science of Optical Design</h2><p>The Art and Science of Optical Design is a comprehensive introduction to lens design, covering the fundamental physical principles and key engineering issues.

He is especially concerned to point out the relations between thinking and arguing, and suggests that the ability to contradict is one of the most important mental faculties.

Furthermore, the mathematical and scientific background of students has changed in recent years. In this book, the subject of dynamics is introduced at undergraduate level through the elementary qualitative theory of differential equations, the geometry of phrase curves and the theory of stability. Each subject, from the most elementary topic to some important discoveries of recent decades, is introduced through simple examples and illustrated with many diagrams. The text is supplemented with over a hundred exercises. The examples and exercises cover subjects as diverse as mechanics and population dynamics. The mathematical background required of the reader is an understanding of the elementary theory of differential equations and matrix arithmetic. The book will be of interest to second-year and third-year undergraduates at universities, polytechnics and technical colleges who are studying science and engineering courses. It is also suitable for graduates and research workers in such fields as plasma, atomic, particle and molecular physics, astronomy and theoretical ecology.</p><p>A new approach to dynamics that takes account of recent advances that have wide applications in the sciences and engineering.

After each visit, Traubel meticulously recorded their conversation, transcribing with such sensitivity that Whitman&#x2019;s friend John Burroughs remarked that he felt he could almost hear the poet breathing. In <i>Walt Whitman Speaks</i>, acclaimed author Brenda Wineapple draws from Traubel&#x2019;s extensive interviews an extraordinary gathering of Whitman&#x2019;s observations that conveys the core of his ethos and vision. Here is Whitman the sage, champion of expansiveness and human freedom. Here, too, is the poet&#x2019;s more personal side&#x2014;his vivid memories of Thoreau, Emerson, and Lincoln, his literary judgments on writers such as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Tolstoy, and his expressions of hope in the democratic promise of the nation he loved. The result is a keepsake edition to touch the soul, capturing the distilled wisdom of America&#x2019;s greatest poet.</p><p><b>Brenda Wineapple</b> is the author of <i>The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation</i>,&nbsp;<i>Ecstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise 1848-1877</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and <i>White Heat: The Friendship of Emily Dickinson and Thomas Wentworth Higginson</i>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. For Library of America, she has edited <i>John Greenleaf Whittier: Selected Poems</i>, volume 10 in the American Poets Project. Wineapple has received a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Guggenheim fellowship, a Pushcart Prize, and, most recently, a National Endowment for the Humanities Public Scholars Award for her forthcoming book on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson."A treasure of Walt unvarnished, reflective and still firing on all cylinders into his 70s. From single sentences to long paragraphs, it is endlessly quotable and perfect for dipping into and savouring."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>The Guardian</b></i><br><br>"Brenda Wineapple&#x2019;s pithy volume, in its bare-bones efficiency, allows us to appreciate ... the best of Whitman&#x2019;s off-the-cuff remarks." &#x2014;<b>Christoph Irmscher,&nbsp;</b><i><b>The Wall Street Journal<br><br></b></i>"This little book samples his rambling chats with friend Traubel in the last years of Whitman&#x2019;s life.

John W. Rowe and Robert L. Kahn created a network of leading research scientists from key fields to determine what aging actually involves. Rejecting the established approach of studying aging in terms of anticipated decline, these scientists set out to identify the factors that were enabling vast numbers of people to preserve and even enhance their mental and physical vitality in later life.<br><br><i>Successful Aging</i> brings together the remarkable results of the study for the first time. They explode the myths about aging that have long shaped individual and institutional attitudes toward growing older, including the biggest myth of all: "The key to aging well is choosing your parents wisely." In fact, they discovered that lifestyle choices--more than genes--determine how well we age. Drs. Rowe and Kahn outline those vital choices, including changes in diet, types of exercise, mental stimulation, self-efficacy, and dynamic connections. These choices can make a difference no matter how late in life they are made. In addition, Drs. Rowe and Kahn include the latest research-based strategies to delay or prevent the common diseases of old age.<br><br>Society can also influence how we age. Drs. Rowe and Kahn detail innovative programs and policies that are enabling older men and women to stay healthy and to continue to contribute to their societies.<br><br>For all of us, the rewards of successful aging are great; this eye-opening work shows how they can be attained and enjoyed.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>This groundbreaking book should definitely help further the movement of what the authors call "a new gerontology." John Rowe, M.D., and Robert Kahn, Ph.D., both members of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network, thoroughly debunk the myth that aging has to be a painful process of debilitation. Their research has shown that the influence of genetics shrinks proportionately as you get older, while social and physical habits become increasingly integral to your state of health--both mental and physical. The 10 years' worth of research cited in <i>Successful Aging</i> reveal some flabbergasting facts about health in later life. For example, an inactive person is worse off, health-wise, than a smoker who exercises regularly. And your lifestyle and attitude are significantly more important than your genes in determining whether or not your golden years are healthy ones--even if you have a genetic predisposition for developing Alzheimer's, arthritis, cancer, or other serious health problems. <p> Rowe and Kahn start with a thorough breakdown of nutritional advice, including a rundown of the many vitamins and other nutrients that those older than 60 are in particular need of. They also detail the most important exercises for optimal functioning of body and mind, and analyze the benefits and risks of DHEA, melatonin, and tretinoin, while warning about snake-oil formulations that are now being marketed to the AARP set. There's also a thorough explanation of the importance of creativity and social connections--the research shows that, for the aging, strong social ties are even more important in preventing illness than genetic background.</p>In this clear and authoritative work, Drs. John W. Rowe and Robert L. Kahn explain that successful aging is largely determined not by genetic inheritance--as common wisdom has it--but by individual lifestyle choices in diet, exercise, the pursuit of mental challenges, self-efficacy, and involvement with other people. This shift in the field of gerontology is due in great measure to the MacArthur Foundation Study of Aging in America, which was begun in 1987 and led by Drs. Rowe and Kahn. Its remarkable results are brought together for the first time in Successful Aging.<br><br>Inspiring and instructive, and based on more than ten years of groundbreaking research, the information and ideas presented here will transform our thinking about the quality of life that it is possible to obtain and sustain as we grow older.</p><h2>The Exemplary Middle School</h2><p>THE EXEMPLARY MIDDLE SCHOOL has been the standard in the field of middle school education for two decades.

African American, Chicano, Asia American, American Indian, women, and queer activists demanded the creation of departments that reflected their histories and experiences, resulting in the formation of interdisciplinary studies programs that hoped to transform both the university and the wider society beyond the campus.</p><p>In <i>The Reorder of Things</i>, however, Roderick A. Ferguson traces and assesses the ways in which the rise of interdisciplines&#x2014;departments of race, gender, and ethnicity; fields such as queer studies&#x2014;were not simply a challenge to contemporary power as manifest in academia, the state, and global capitalism but were, rather, constitutive of it. Ferguson delineates precisely how minority culture and difference as affirmed by legacies of the student movements were appropriated and institutionalized by established networks of power.</p><p>Critically examining liberationist social movements and the cultural products that have been informed by them, including works by Adrian Piper, Toni Cade Bambara, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Zadie Smith, <i>The Reorder of Things</i> argues for the need to recognize the vulnerabilities of cultural studies to co-option by state power and to develop modes of debate and analysis that may be in the institution but are, unequivocally, not of it.<i><br><br></i></p></p><p><p>Roderick A. Ferguson is professor of race and critical theory at the University of Minnesota. He is the author of <i>Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique </i>(Minnesota, 2003) and the coeditor of <i>Strange Affinities: The Gender and Sexual Politics of Comparative Racialization.</i></p>""The Reorder of Things" marks a bold and necessary intervention into our understandings of how (neoliberal) hegemony works at this moment--not simply to coopt, but to contain the very difference it makes into abstraction. This is a moment of fire when we are being called upon to kindle a different kind of radical collectivity. Roderick A. Ferguson is the ancient blacksmith forging a new alchemy, which we, too, can hammer out--but only if we dare." --M. Jacqui Alexander, author of "Pedagogies of Crossing: Meditations on Feminism, Sexual Politics, Memory and the Sacred"<br>"Especially now, when the rhetoric of crisis is the norm in discussions of the present and the future of the university, "The Reorder of Things "is urgently needed. Its persistent attention to the genealogies of minority difference--of racial formation, class divisions, and gender and sex systems--definitively establishes the academy as both a flashpoint for the crystallization of what we commonly understand to be sociopolitical issues and a major part of the machinery of history. Ferguson incisively, elegantly shows us how to think differently--how to think in and through difference--and in the process, changes the horizons of knowledge itself." --Kandice Chuh, CUNY/The Graduate Center<br></p><h2>The Richard Rodgers Reader (Readers on American Musicians)</h2><p>Richard Rodgers was one of America's most prolific and best-loved composers. A world without "My Funny Valentine," "The Lady is a Tramp," "Blue Moon," and "Bewitched," to name just a few of the songs he wrote with Lorenz Hart, is scarcely imaginable, and the musicals he wrote with his second collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein--<em>Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I</em>, and <em>The Sound of Music</em>--continue to enchant and entertain audiences. <br><br>Arranged in four sections, Rodgers and Hart (1929-1943), Rodgers and Hammerstein (1943-1960), Rodgers After Hammerstein (1960-1979), and The Composer Speaks (1939-1971), <em>The Richard Rodgers Reader</em> offers a cornucopia of informative, perceptive, and stylish biographical and critical overviews. It also contains a selection of Rodgers's letters to his wife Dorothy in the 1920s, the 1938 <em>Time</em> magazine cover story and <em>New Yorker</em> profiles in 1938 and 1961, and essays and reviews by such noted critics as Brooks Atkinson, Eric Bentley, Leonard Bernstein, Lehman Engel, Walter Kerr, Ken Mandelbaum, Ethan Mordden, George Jean Nathan, and Alec Wilder. The volume features personal accounts by Richard Adler, Agnes de Mille, Joshua Logan, Mary Martin, and Diahann Carroll. The collection concludes with complete selections from more than thirty years of Rodgers's own writings on topics ranging from the creative process, the state of the Broadway theater, even Rodgers's bout with cancer, and a generous sample from the candid and previously unpublished Columbia University interviews. <br><br>For anyone wishing to explore more fully the life and work of a composer whose songs and musicals have assumed a permanent--and prominent--place in American popular culture, <em>The Richard Rodgers Reader</em> will offer endless delights.<br></p><p><br><strong>Geoffrey Block</strong> is Professor of Music History at the University of Puget Sound.

While certain basic criteria&#x2014;borders, a government, and recognition from other countries&#x2014;seem obvious, journalist Joshua Keating&#x2019;s book explores exceptions to these rules, including self-proclaimed countries such as Abkhazia, Kurdistan, and Somaliland, a Mohawk reservation straddling the U.S.-Canada border, and an island nation whose very existence is threatened by climate change. Through stories about these would-be countries&#x2019; efforts at self-determination, as well as their respective challenges, Keating shows that there is no universal legal authority determining what a country is. He argues that although our current world map appears fairly static, economic, cultural, and environmental forces in the places he describes may spark change. Keating ably ties history to incisive and sympathetic observations drawn from his travels and personal interviews with residents, political leaders, and scholars in each of these &#x201c;invisible countries.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Joshua Keating</b> is a foreign policy analyst, staff writer, and editor at <i>Slate.</i> Previously he was an editor at <i>Foreign Policy.</i>&#x201c;Mr. Keating offers few answers, but he raises good questions.

It nevertheless has a rich avifauna. By the end of 2017, 751 species (including 765 subspecies) were known to occur in Suriname. Most of the land area of Suriname is still covered with tropical rainforest and the country should be a must-visit for birdwatchers. Suriname is even mentioned as being the best country to spot certain neotropical species. Surprisingly, few birders visit Suriname. The main reason given is the lack of a handy pocket guide that can easily be carried in a backpack. This (revised and updated) edition of the <i>Field Guide to the Birds of Suriname</i> (with its 109 color plates) tries to fill this gap. In addition to species accounts, data on topography, climate, geology, geomorphology, biogeography, avifauna composition, conservation, and hotspots for bird watching are given.

The essays include historiographical studies of the treatment of the topic by French and other historians as well as important case studies on the political vocabularies characteristic of the ancien r�gime and the revolutionary periods. The result is a substantial and unified set of studies on one of the central themes in modern European history.</p><p>A unified set of essays on one of the central themes in modern European history--the ideological origins of the French Revolution--includes historiographical studies as well as case studies.How did the French Revolution become thinkable? Keith Michael Baker, a leading authority on the ideological origins of the French Revolution, explores this question in his wide-ranging collection of essays. Analyzing the new politics of contestation that transformed the traditional political culture of the Old Regime during its last decades, Baker revises our historical map of the political space in which the French Revolution took form. Some essays study the ways in which the revolutionaries&#39; break with the past was prepared by competition between agents and critics of absolute monarchy to control the cultural resources and political meanings of French history; by the contending political vocabularies in which the French sought before 1789 to reconstitute their body politic; and by the invention of &#34;public opinion&#34; as a new form of political authority displacing absolute rule. Others trace to the conceptual improvisation of revolutionary notions of &#34;representation&#34;, &#34;constitution&#34;, &#34;sovereignty&#34; -- and of &#34;the French Revolution&#34; itself -- the ambiguities, tensions, and contradictions that were to drive the revolutionary dynamic in subsequent years. The result is a substantial and unified set of studies, stimulating renewed reflection on one of the central themes in modern European history.</p><h2>The Church of Irresistible Influence</h2><p>An inspiring description and story showing how a church can become an irresistible influence on its neighborhood, community, and world by building bridges over troubled waters to a dying culture through showing the love of God in action.</p><p>A city set on a hill, inescapably visible. A lit lamp brilliantly illuminating the darkest room. <p>With compelling metaphors, Jesus described the church and its impact on the world. And indeed, filled with the Holy Spirit, the early church demonstrated a spiritual energy and depth that transformed the surrounding culture. </p><p>Yet today, instead of turning the world upside-down, we&#x2019;ve largely turned it off. When people think of church at all, a sobering majority view it as big on ideals but short on reality. We have a choice. We can maintain our trajectory and descend into irrelevance. Or we can reclaim our incomparable birthright--the irresistible influence of a church vitally connected with God, each other, and the world around us. </p><p>The Church of Irresistible Influence is about church transformation, about a vision worth living for and changing for because it pulses with the very heartbeat of God. If you are a pastor or church leader, prepare to be inspired, challenged, and equipped with practical insights for making your church a strong, well-traveled link between heaven and earth in your community. </p><p>Using bridges as a metaphor for irresistible influence--or i2, as he calls it--Robert Lewis shares the experiences and lessons of Fellowship Bible Church to show you: *What it will take to reconnect your church with your community *The how-to&#x2019;s of "incarnational bridge building" *True stories of i2 in action *How to expand the i2 effort through new partnerships and adventures *Requirements of the church in the 21st century </p><p>Passionate, thought-provoking, and personal, this book will plant the want-to and pave the way for your church--no matter your size or location--to become a church of irresistible influence in your God-ordained corner of the world.</p>Dr. Robert Lewis is pastor of Fellowship Bible Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, founder of Men&#39;s Fraternity, and chairman of the board of Fellowship Associates, a church consulting and leadership training organization.

His expanding portfolio of important civic architecture, public buildings, and urban planning commissions spans Europe, the United States, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. He transforms complex ideas and concepts into approachable and innovative structures that respond to the geographical, ecological, technological, engineering, economic, and cultural systems that shape the practice of global architecture. The publication of this compendium of work and essays coincides with the scheduled opening of Adjaye&#x2019;s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Adjaye&#x2019;s completed work in the United States includes the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, a pair of public libraries in D.C., and several private residences. He is also known for his collaborations with artists, most recently with the British painter Chris Ofili (b. 1968).<br> &nbsp;<br> Following an introduction by Zo� Ryan, Adjaye writes on his current and future work, with subsequent essays by an extraordinary cadre of architectural scholars on Adjaye&#x2019;s master plans and urban planning, transnational architecture, monuments and memorials, and, finally, the forthcoming museum in D.C.

(Third Edition)</h2><p>Are Islam and the West on a collision course? From the Ayatollah Khomeini to Saddam Hussein, the image of Islam as a militant, expansionist, and rabidly anti-American religion has gripped the minds of Western governments and media. But these perceptions, John L. Esposito writes, stem from a long history of mutual distrust, criticism, and condemnation, and are far too simplistic to help us understand one of the most important political issues of our time. In this new edition of <em>The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?</em>, Esposito places the challenge of Islam in critical perspective. Exploring the vitality of this religion as a global force and the history of its relations with the West, Esposito demonstrates the diversity of the Islamic resurgence--and the mistakes our analysts make in assuming a hostile, monolithic Islam. This third edition has been expanded to include new material on current affairs in Turkey, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Southeast Asia, as well as a discussion of international terrorism.<br></p><p>John L.

Goetz claimed to have fired in self-defense, out of fear that the young men were about to rob him. <br></p><p>Those wanting a sensationalized account of the controversial case of Bernhard Goetz, who shot four young black men on a New York subway in 1984, are advised to look elsewhere. This study by a law professor at Columbia University is a measured examination of the case from its investigation to the sentencing of the defendant, with emphasis on the legal question involved. Fletcher supports the advocacy system used in American courtrooms and emphasizes its stress on reason in the law. He explains the law as it applies to self-defense: an attack must be imminent, the defender's response must be both necessary and proportional, and the defender must act with the intention of thwarting the attack. The author lays this groundwork carefully to show why the jury found Goetz innocent of the major charges against him. In the tradition of legal scholarship, Fletcher does not present his personal views on the case. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This thought-provoking analysis of legal issues concerns the Goetz case. Goetz, the so-called "subway vigilante," shot four black teenagers on the subway in New York City. His main alibi was self-defense. Fletcher, a Columbia University law professor, discusses the judicial history and interpretation of self-defense. He then leads us through the trial, which resulted in Goetz's acquittal on all charges except gun possession. Fletcher dwells at length on implications, balancing a person's right to self-defense vs. society's need to maintain order. Though the analysis is highly legalistic, Fletcher conveys his ideas in a style easily understood by lay readers. Highly recommended. Sandra K. Lindheimer, Middlesex Law Lib.

He was orphaned before he was three and was taken in by his godfather, John Allan, a merchant of Richmond, Virginia. After incurring gambling debts at the University of Virginia, he joined the army where, at eighteen, he published his first poems. He was dismissed from West Point, and then worked for various literary magazines. In 1836, while living in Baltimore, he married his fourteen-year-old cousin. He achieved acclaim for the Raven in 1845; two years later his wife died. In October of 1849, shortly after his engagement to a love of his youth, Poe was found semiconscious in the streets of Baltimore. He died days later.</p><h2>Invisible Giants: Fifty Americans Who Shaped the Nation but Missed the History Books</h2><p>Because history is as fallible as the people who record it, many of the figures who have shaped our country have receded from public memory.

Although it is considered largely a self-help system, the authors do recommend consulting a professional occasionally. Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly easier to do in Great Britain (the authors are British), where homeopathy is more widely accepted and practiced. Comprehensive and straightforward, the guide covers fertility, beauty care, menstrual problems, and many more areas of female health, including "A-Z of Other Conditions." For whatever reason, the more general, that is, nonhomeopathic, advice tends to be more conservative and even conflicts with the usual "alternative" guide. Nonetheless, this book appears to be useful for the general public. <i>Jo Peer-Haas</i>Although there are several general guides to homeopathic medicine, this book, excellent in its own right, is all the more valuable as the only title to deal exclusively with women's health problems. Part 1 describes homeopathy--material that can easily be found in other sources. Part 2 takes 13 common health concerns of women and details their causes, symptoms, and treatment. Part 3, "A-Z of Other Conditions," briefly suggests treatments for other diseases. The authors, both British M.D.s, always recommend a balance between homeopathic and more mainstream kinds of medical care. Several appendixes include a general remedy finder where the reader can look up homeopathic treatment for individual diseases and a listing of the ingredients of homeopathic remedies. There is also a short chapter on nutrition. Recommended for large alternative or women's health collections.<br><i>- Natalie Kupferberg, Montana State Univ.

Can it ever be fixed? These are the questions that motivate Michael Tomasky&#x2019;s deeply original examination into the origins of our hopelessly polarized nation. &#x201c;One of America&#x2019;s finest political commentators&#x201d; (Michael J. Sandel), Tomasky ranges across centuries and disciplines to show how America has almost always had two dominant parties that are existentially, and often violently, opposed. When he turns to our current era, he does so with striking insight that will challenge readers to reexamine what they thought they knew. Finally, not content merely to diagnose these problems, Tomasky offers a provocative agenda for how we can help fix our broken political system&#x2015;from ranked-choice voting and at-large congressional elections to expanding high school civics education nationwide.</p><p>Combining revelatory data with trenchant analysis, Tomasky tells us how the nation broke apart and points us toward a more hopeful political future.</p> 8 black and white photographs</p><p>Michael Tomasky&nbsp;is a columnist for the Daily Beast, a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books, and the editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas. He lives in Maryland.&#x201c;Sweeping, rollicking, sometimes breezy political and cultural back story to our current moment, one that demands we become informed... Indeed, the most helpful -- if sobering -- point Tomasky makes is that while our current troubles created the conditions that brought us a President Trump, those troubles would exist no matter who was in the White House. And it will take much more than a new occupant to fix them.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jason Zengerle, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Daily Beast</em> columnist Tomasky confirms what we already knew&#x2015;America is polarized&#x2015;and masterfully charts how it always has been that way, especially at the beginning... The author expertly sifts through American history, citing compromises, which mostly made everyone unhappy. Refreshingly, Tomasky also offers 'A Fourteen-Point Agenda to Reduce Polarization,' which includes a host of reasonable ideas....

Michael Tomasky walks you through this country&#x2019;s often raucous journey from division to division to occasional unity and back to division again. He also offers some common-sense ways that we can yet recover our collective sanity.&#x201d;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joy Reid, host of MSNBC's <i>AM Joy</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>If We Can Keep It</em> is a brilliant and timely answer to the most important questions in contemporary politics: how did we get here&#x2015;and how do we get out? Tomasky&#x2019;s account of our polarized society is informed by a broad knowledge of history and a rich understanding of the country that Donald Trump, amazingly enough, serves as President.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeffrey Toobin, CNN legal analyst and author of <i>American Heiress</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Tomasky, one of America&#x2019;s finest political commentators, gives us a synoptic account of our broken politics, and a far-reaching program to fix it. The polarization that afflicts politics today is not a fact of nature, he reminds us, but the result of cultural changes and political choices over the past several decades. Tomasky&#x2019;s bold proposals for reform offer a fresh take on how to repair our fractured republic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael J.

But in this spirited <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, famed critic Terry Eagleton takes a serious if often amusing look at the question and offers his own surprising answer.<br><br>Eagleton first examines how centuries of thinkers and writers--from Marx and Schopenhauer to Shakespeare, Sartre, and Beckett--have responded to the ultimate question of meaning. He suggests, however, that it is only in modern times that the question has become problematic. But instead of tackling it head-on, many of us cope with the feelings of meaninglessness in our lives by filling them with everything from football to sex, Kabbala, Scientology, "New Age softheadedness," or fundamentalism. On the other hand, Eagleton notes, many educated people believe that life is an evolutionary accident that has no intrinsic meaning. If our lives have meaning, it is something with which we manage to invest them, not something with which they come ready made. Eagleton probes this view of meaning as a kind of private enterprise, and concludes that it fails to holds up. He argues instead that the meaning of life is not a solution to a problem, but a matter of living in a certain way. It is not metaphysical but ethical. It is not something separate from life, but what makes it worth living--that is, a certain quality, depth, abundance and intensity of life. <br><br>Here then is a brilliant discussion of the problem of meaning by a leading thinker, who writes with a light and often irreverent touch, but with a very serious end in mind.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.</p><p><br><strong>Terry Eagleton</strong> is Professor of Cultural Theory and John Rylands Fellow at the University of Manchester.

An additional essay demonstrates how these various approaches can be combined.</p><p>Gustave Dore's magnificent engravings for <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> are among the later works of the great French illustrator. The intensely evocative poem provided Dor� with the long-awaited opportunity to convey limitless space on a gigantic scale, and he exploited the poem's fantastic range of atmosphere to the limits of its possibilities. The terrifying space of the open sea, the storms and whirlpools of an unknown ocean, the vast icy caverns of Antarctica, the hot equatorial sea swarming with monsters, all of the amazing visual elements that make Coleridge's masterpiece one of the most exciting and most memorable poems in the English language are unforgettably engraved in Dor�'s plates.<br>This edition reproduces all of the plates to perfection, in their original size. The illustrations and the text of the poem appear on facing pages, so that the imaginative kinship of Dor� and Coleridge is delightfully evident on every page: the illustrations capture all the moods of the poem in their full intensity, bringing the images evoked by the words into clear visual focus.<br>Unabridged and slightly rearranged republication of the 1878 American edition.

Alcorn Jr. formulates a systematic explanation of the function and value of desire in writing instruction. </p><p>Alcorn argues that in changing the subject matter of writing instruction in order to change student opinions, composition instructors have come to adopt an insufficiently complex understanding of subjectivity. This oversimplification hinders attempts to foster cultural change. Alcorn proposes an alternative mode of instruction that makes effective use of students&#x2019; knowledge and desire. The resulting freedom in expression&#x2015;personal as well as political&#x2015;engenders the recognition, circulation, and elaboration of desire necessary for both human communication and effective politics. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Responding to James Berlin&#x2019;s reconception of praxis in the classroom, Theresa Ebert&#x2019;s espousal of disciplined instructions, and Lester Faigley&#x2019;s introduction of a postmodern theory of subjectivity, Alcorn follows both Lacan and Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek in insisting desire be given free voice and serious recognition. In composition as in politics, desire is the ground of agency. Competing expressions of desire should generate a dialectic in social-epistemic discourse that encourages enlightenment over cynicism and social development over authoritarian demands. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With clarity and personal voice, Alcorn explains how discourse is rooted in primitive psychological functions of desire and responds to complex cultural needs. In its theoretical scope this book describes a new pedagogy that links thought to emotion and the personal to the social.</p></p><p><b>Marshall W.

Scholars have long assumed that rather than exploring or contemplating the natural world, the Jews of medieval Ashkenaz were preoccupied solely with the supernatural and otherworldly: magic and mysticism, demonology and divination, as well as the zombies, werewolves, dragons, flying camels, and other monstrous and wondrous creatures that destabilized any pretense of a consistent and encompassing natural order.</p><p>In <i>A Remembrance of His Wonders</i>, David I. Shyovitz disputes this long-standing and far-reaching consensus. Analyzing a wide array of neglected Ashkenazic writings on the natural world in general, and the human body in particular, Shyovitz shows how Jews in Ashkenaz integrated regnant scientific, magical, and mystical currents into a sophisticated exploration of the boundaries between nature and the supernatural. Ashkenazic beliefs and practices that have often been seen as signs of credulity and superstition in fact mirrored&#x2014;and drew upon&#x2014;contemporaneous Christian debates over the relationship between God and the natural world. In charting these parallels between Jewish and Christian thought, Shyovitz focuses especially upon the mediating role of polemical texts and encounters that served as mechanisms for the transmission of religious doctrines, scientific facts, and cultural mores. Medieval Jews' preoccupation with the apparently "supernatural" reflected neither ignorance nor intellectual isolation but rather a determined effort to understand nature's inner workings and outer limits and to integrate and interrogate the theologies and ideologies of the broader European Christian society.</p></p><p>David I. Shyovitz teaches history and Jewish studies at Northwestern University.<p>"<i>A Remembrance of His Wonders</i> is an excellent achievement that deals with central research questions regarding the understanding of the wondrous in nature by the Jews of Ashkenaz. David I. Shyovitz presents fascinating parallels between the writings of the German Pietists and contemporary Christian texts, showing that their understandings of nature are quite similar."&#x2014;Israel Yuval, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</p><br><br><p>"This book advances a bold and original interpretation of Jewish engagement with the natural world in the Middle Ages . . . Ultimately Shyovitz does more than simply show that Jews in French- and German- speaking Europe studied the natural world; he suggests that their works had an afterlife. He shows that Jewish thinkers from throughout the early modern world read, internalized, and applied the insights of the medieval Ashkenazic forebears. Thanks to Shyovitz's hard work, clear writing, and keen historical sense, the texts he unearthed and presented to a broad academic readership have earned multiple afterlives, not only in later Jewish writings but in modern scholarship as well."&#x2014;<i>Isis</i></p></p><h2>The Politics of Birth</h2><p>The Politics of Birth explores ways in which we learn about birth, how we talk and feel about it, assumptions that professional caregivers may make, and the roles and skills of midwives.

The complex and often controversial history of the early republic is analyzed with reference to its internal development, the evolution of its relationships with the Latins, and its ruthless assaults upon various parts of Italy. Later sections discuss the intervention of Pyrrhus and its aftermath which leads to consideration of Rome&#39;s relationships with Carthage, the First Punic War, and the beginnings of overseas empire.</p><p>This volume of the second edition of the Cambridge Ancient History traces the history of Rome from its origins to the eve of the Second Punic War.

Knight's masterful biography, reveals&nbsp;Addams's early development as a political activist and social philosopher.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this book&nbsp;we observe&nbsp;a powerful mind&nbsp;grappling with&nbsp;the radical ideas of her age, most notably the ever-changing meanings of democracy.<br><br><i>Citizen</i> covers the first half of Addams's life, from 1860 to 1899. Knight recounts how Addams, a child of a wealthy family in&nbsp;rural northern Illinois, longed for a life of larger purpose. She broadened her horizons through education, reading, and travel, and, after receiving an inheritance upon her father's death, moved to Chicago in 1889 to co-found Hull House, the city's first settlement house. <i>Citizen</i> shows vividly what the settlement house actually was&#x2014;a neighborhood center for education and social gatherings&#x2014;and describes how Addams learned of the abject working conditions in American factories, the unchecked power wielded by employers, the impact of corrupt local politics on city services, and the intolerable limits placed on women by their lack of voting rights. These experiences, Knight makes clear, transformed Addams.

Knight&#x2019;s excellent book makes the case for Addams as a preeminent social thinker and a masterful politician. Knight will have none of Saint Jane; and her biography should forever dispel the lingering assumption that Addams was the church lady of progressivism. She gives us instead a woman who took up residence&#x2014;quite literally, when she rented Hull House&#x2014;in the life of her times, eschewing the limits (and the protections) of her sex and refusing to don the veil of Christian charity. Addams entered into the afflictions and aspirations of poor people, and from there she pushed, uninvited, into the back rooms where politicians made the decisions that pressed on poor people&#x2019;s lives.&#x201d; (Christine Stansell <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"[<i>Citizen</i>] is enviably well-written and deeply engrossing, and a considerable addition to the literature, not just on an extraordinary woman, but on an extraordinary epoch."

In many ways, <i>Citizen</i> is the story of Addams&#x2019;s intellectual journey.

I say that with some hesitation for fear that prospective readers will think the book too heady.

Her study does not shy away from examining Addams&#x2019; ambition, her complicated personal relationships, and her prejudices. Knight&#x2019;s careful dissection of every element of Addams&#x2019;s transformation from a typical member of her class to an exceptional reformer only serves to further emphasize Addams&#x2019;s significance to the history of women and to American history in general.&#x201d; (Katherine G.

Written by one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on the link between obesity and diabetes, this passionate, frightening&#x2013;but ultimately hopeful&#x2013;book points the way to a solution.<br><br>To enter Dr. Francine Kaufman&#x2019;s clinic is to see the future of America: a 220-pound twelve-year-old boy...a 267-pound thirteen-year-old girl...their concerned but equally overweight parents...the human faces and human suffering behind the epidemic of type 2 diabetes that threatens to overwhelm our health care system. Once a disease of the elderly, type 2 diabetes now strikes adults in their prime&#x2013;and, increasingly, children. It has nearly doubled in the last decade. The cause? Our soaring rates of obesity.<br><br>Diabesity takes us to the front lines of the fight against this preventable but deadly disease. Through vivid patient stories, it explains how excess weight destroys the body&#x2019;s ability to process sugar properly&#x2013;with life-threatening consequences. It shows what happens when the genes that evolved to protect us from famine collide with a sedentary lifestyle that has put bacon cheeseburgers on every corner. And it demonstrates why our usual blame-the-victim response is futile in face of the complex, worldwide forces behind this epidemic.<br><br>Detailing the tools for change at every level&#x2013;from families to school systems to government&#x2013;and reporting on innovative programs that are already making a difference, Diabesity offers a compelling action plan for winning this battle.</p><p>Just as <i>Fast Food Nation</i> appalled thousands of readers into boycotting McDonalds and its ilk, one can hope that <i>Diabesity</i> might galvanize the public to help prevent a mind-bogglingly huge epidemic from snowballing. Type II diabetes used to be a disease of the elderly; in 1997, the American Diabetes Association decided to do away with the term "adult-onset diabetes," as it increasingly appeared in middle-aged patients, young adults, and teens. It's now appearing in obese children, and affects nearly 10 percent of the American population;[p. 13] what's most unbelievable is that its prevalence nearly <i>doubled</i> between 1990 and 2002, and shows no signs of abating, as every overweight American--that's 64 percent of the population--is at elevated risk. <p> <i>Diabesity</i> will likely petrify anyone recently diagnosed with diabetes into scrupulously monitoring their blood-sugar level, with frightening stories of blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure, gangrene, impotence in males, and infertility in females, and other side effects from diabetics' elevated blood sugar. Dr. Kaufman gets a little full of herself when she describes audiences&#x2014;from school boards to World Health Organization assemblies&#x2014;going wild after her speeches on diabetes. But as a pediatric endocrinologist since the 1970s, she's seen first-hand the rise of the diabetes epidemic, with comatose children appearing in her Los Angeles emergency room with blood-sugar levels 10 times what's considered healthy, so high that they can't be read with present-day equipment. </p><p> Curiously absent in <i>Diabesity</i> is any mention of the potential link between infant formula and the later development of diabetes. But Kaufman wins points for chronicling the fight to have L.A. ban soda sales in the schools. ("Sodas are the leading source of added sugar in children's diets.") Her descriptions of the cultural and economic differences among the diabetes epidemics in China, India, and Ecuador are also intriguing. The book should be considered essential for parents, teachers, and day-care providers; it's grim reading, but that's a small sacrifice compared to a life being cut short 20 years by a largely preventable disease. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Diabetes is a life-threatening disease. DIABESITY opens with Dr. Francine R. Kaufman's middle-of-the night rescue of a comatose infant with type 1 diabetes, followed by her shocked diagnosis of a 267-pound thirteen-year-old girl with type 2. The girl is accompanied by her wheelchair-bound grandmother--a bitter woman who has suffered a heart attack, stroke, and foot amputation, all a result of uncontrolled diabetes. Dr. Kaufman is determined to keep the girl from the same fate. But type-2 diabetes is exploding into epidemic proportions, and she and her colleagues realize that the forces arrayed against them dwarf even the most heroic medical interventions.<p>The first part of this book builds on vivid and involving patient stories to explain the two kinds of diabetes, how they affect the body, and how they are treated--with a primary focus on type 2, which is directly caused by obesity and is now 90% of the more than 17 million known cases in the United States. It is an eye-opening look at how our bodies use sugar, how much can go wrong when it is not precisely regulated, and the day-to-day demands of this deadly disease.</p><p>Part two explains how we have come to this crisis: What happens when the genes that enabled us to survive 2.5 million years of scarcity and famine collide with a lifestyle that has put bacon cheeseburgers, sodas, and fries on nearly every corner. Unlike many writers on obesity, Dr. Kaufman does not adopt a blame-the-patient stance. From the story of her own diabetic grandmother to children overfed on school lunch programs, she shows just how complex the issues are.</p><p>Part three is a call to action, with solutions for individuals, families, communities, schools, the health care sector, and government. It details the tools for change--among them many innovative, successful programs that are already in existence--and offers real, concrete hope that this is a battle we can fight and win.</p></p><h2>Complementary Therapies in Rehabilitation: Evidence for Efficacy in Therapy, Prevention, and Wellness</h2><p><p><i><strong>Complementary Therapies in Rehabilitation</strong></i> has been revised and updated to include the latest information about holistic therapies and evidence of their efficacy.

Civilian rather than military armies, they were created to obtain food and military equipment from the reluctant and frequently anti-revolutionary rural populace in order to supply the towns and the soldiers fighting on the frontiers. Composed of urban, highly politicized &#39;sans-culottes&#39;, they interacted with rural villages in a way that reflected the age-old conflict between town and country. This classic book by the famed historian Richard Cobb describes the clash between the swaggering, insubordinate &#39;sans-culottes&#39; and the crafty villagers and in so doing, provides important insighyts into aspects of the social and administrative history of the French Revolution. &#39;The People&#39;s Armies&#39; was first published in France in 1961 and has now been translated into English by Marianne Elliott. This book was Cobb&#39;s first major work and is still generally regarded as his most important contribution to French history. It illustrates all those characteristics that have come to be seen as typical of Cobb&#39;s distinctive historical style: the concern with local colour and variation, the vignettes that evoke in vivid detail all the hues of daily life at the time of the French Revolution, and, most of all, the sound basis of detailed and wide-ranging research. The book has had a profound influence on the study of the French Revolution and is still unsurpassed as a history of an important institution of the period of Revolutionary government in France. Richard Cobb was professor of modern European history at Oxford University.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)The first English-language publication of Cobb's major work (published in French, 1961, 1963). Using a plethora of archival sources, the book details the story of the civilian armies of the Revolutionary Terror from April 1793 to March 1794. Composed of urban, highly politicized sans-culottes, these armies were created to obtain food and military equipment for soldiers on the frontiers and for urban populations from reluctant, often antirevolutionary, rural residents. A godsend for Revolutionary scholars, this fine translation belongs in every relevant academic collection and will interest the general reader as well. Highly recommended. William C.

Her crisp style and skillful observation of people and places gives her work lasting appeal.</p><p>The Country of the Pointer Firs, Sarah Orne Jewett&#39;s masterpiece, established her among the consummate stylists of nineteenth-century American fiction. Composed in a series of beautiful web-like sketches, the novel is narrated by a young woman writer who unfolds a New England idyll rooted in friendship, particularly female friendship, weaving stories and conversations, imagery of sea, sky and earth, the tang of salt air and aromatic herbs into an historically significant &#39;fiction of community&#39; in which themes and form are exquisitely matched. This edition, introduced by Alison Easton, also includes ten of Sarah Orne Jewett&#39;s short stories, among them &#39;The Queen&#39;s Twin&#39;, &#39;The Foreigner&#39; and &#39;William&#39;s Wedding&#39;.<b>Sarah Orne Jewett </b>was born in Maine on September 3, 1849, and grew up in the small town of South Berwick where she was to spend the principal part of her life. Ill health prevented her from fulfilling her ambition to become a doctor; she turned to writing instead. Her first story was published when she was 18, and her literary production continued unabated until a crippling carriage accident in 1902 ended her creative career. She died on June 24, 1909, leaving behind a remarkable literary legacy.&nbsp;<br><br><b>WILLA CATHER</b>&nbsp;was probably born in Virginia in 1873, although her parents did not register the date, and it is probably incorrectly given on her tombstone. Because she is so famous for her Nebraska novels, many people assume she was born there, but Willa Cather was about nine years old when her family moved to a small Nebraska frontier town called Red Cloud that was populated by immigrant Swedes, Bohemians, Germans, Poles, Czechs, and Russians. The oldest of seven children, she was educated at home, studied Latin with a&nbsp;neighbor, and read the English classics in the evening. By the time she went to the University of Nebraska in 1891&#x2013;where she began by wearing boy&#x2019;s clothes and cut her hair close to her head&#x2013;she had decided to be a writer.After graduation she worked for a Lincoln, Nebraska, newspaper, then moved to Pittsburgh and finally to New York City. There she joined&nbsp;<i>McClure&#x2019;s&nbsp;</i>magazine, a popular muckraking periodical that encouraged the writing of new young authors. After meeting the author Sarah Orne Jewett, she decided to quit journalism and devote herself full time to fiction. Her first novel<i>, Alexander&#x2019;s Bridge</i>, appeared in serial form in&nbsp;<i>McClure&#x2019; s</i>&nbsp;in 1912. But her place in American literature was established with her first Nebraska novel,&nbsp;<i>O Pioneers!,</i>&nbsp;published in 1913, which was followed by her most famous pioneer novel,&nbsp;<i>My Antonia,</i>&nbsp;in 1918. In 1922 she won the Pulitzer Prize for one of her lesser-known books,&nbsp;<i>One of Ours. Death Comes for the Archbishop</i>&nbsp;(1927), her masterpiece, and&nbsp;<i>Shadows on the Rock</i>&nbsp;(1931) also celebrated the pioneer spirit, but in the Southwest and French Canada. Her other novels include&nbsp;<i>The Song of the Lark</i>&nbsp;(1915),&nbsp;<i>The Professor&#x2019; s House</i>&nbsp;(1925),&nbsp;<i>My Mortal Enemy</i>&nbsp;(1926), and&nbsp;<i>Lucy Gayheart</i>&nbsp;(1935). She died in 1947.</p><h2>Rebellion, Reconstruction, and Redemption, 1861&#x2013;1893: The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina</h2><p>In Rebellion, Reconstruction, and Redemption, 1861-1893, the second of three volumes on the history of Beaufort County, Stephen R. Wise and Lawrence S. Rowland offer details about the district from 1861 to 1893, which influenced the development of the South Carolina and the nation. During a span of thirty years the region was transformed by the crucible of war from a wealthy, slave-based white oligarchy to a county where former slaves dominated a new, radically democratic political economy. <br><br>This volume begins where volume I concluded, the November 1861 Union capture and occupation of the Sea Islands clustered around Port Royal Sound, and the Confederate retreat and re-entrenchment on Beaufort District's mainland, where they fended off federal attacks for three and a half years and vainly attempted to maintain their pre-war life. In addition to chronicling numerous military actions that revolutionized warfare, Wise and Rowland offer an original, sophisticated study of the famous Port Royal Experiment in which United States military officers, government officials, civilian northerners, African American soldiers, and liberated slaves transformed the Union-occupied corner of the Palmetto State into a laboratory for liberty and a working model of the post-Civil War New South. <br><br>The revolution wrought by Union victory and the political and social Reconstruction of South Carolina was followed by a counterrevolution called Redemption, the organized campaign of Southern whites, defeated in the war, to regain supremacy over African Americans. While former slave-owning, anti-black "Redeemers" took control of mainland Beaufort County, they were thwarted on the Sea Islands, where African Americans retained power and kept reaction at bay. By 1893, elements of both the New and Old South coexisted uneasily side by side as the old Beaufort District was divided into Beaufort and Hampton counties. The Democratic mainland reverted to an agricultural-based economy while the Republican Sea Islands and the town of Beaufort underwent an economic boom based on the phosphate mining industry and the new commercial port in the lowcountry town of Port Royal.</p><p>Stephen R.

He becomes Wolcott's subject in a long-term life history on how the educational system can fail students. Wolcott's trilogy of articles based on their years of interviews were well-received...until he admitted to an intimate relationship with the young man who, two years after leaving his shack, returned and attempted to murder the anthropologist. The Brad Trilogy then became the focus of heated academic discussions of research ethics, validity, intimacy, and the limitations of qualitative research. Here, Wolcott presents the full story of the Sneaky Kid and the firestorm it caused. Written in Wolcott's masterful style, the case offers an ideal starting point for discussing the complex public and personal dimensions of qualitative research with students. Included as an Appendix is the complete script of Johnny Saldana's ethnodrama recounting the story in play form.</p><p>Harry F. Wolcott (1929-2012) was professor emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Oregon and a leading author in anthropology and research methods. Wolcott's major works include anthropological studies of American education: Teachers Versus Technocrats and The Man in the Principal's Office: An Ethnography. He also wrote extensively on fieldwork and writing: Transforming Qualitative Data; The Art of Fieldwork; Ethnography: A Way of Seeing; and Writing Up Qualitative Data and is the author of the more recent Sneaky Kid and Its Aftermath: Ethics and Intimacy in Fieldwork (all published by AltaMira Press).<br>Johnny Saldana is a Professor of Theatre at Arizona State University, and his studies in qualitative research range from ethnography to ethnotheatre. He has written several articles on theatre teachers' perceptions of their practice, and young people's development as audiences and artists. One of these studies includes the ethnodrama "Maybe someday, if I'm famous...", a one-act case study of an adolescent actor.What a tour de force, a marvelous accomplishment! Such honesty and plain talking is seldom seen in the social sciences. (Norman K. Denzin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br><br>Brad's story began as a case study Wolcott completed on the failures of education. . . . Wolcott published an article on the experience and this topic. This article remains a well-reference source among qualitative researchers. . . . [Wolcott] proves his adeptness as an anthropologist as he is able to capture adequately the specificities of a particular moment and place and, at the same time, indicate their relevance to a much broader social context, in this case, the dilemmas we face as qualitative researchers today. . . . The book's story reminds us again and again of the inadequacies in schooling for many of our youth, the continued stigmatization and suspicions about homosexuality, and the complex dilemmas of ethics in educational research. . . . An ethno drama is included, written by Johnny Saldana, entitled, 'Finding my place: The Brad Trilogy.' Finally, with the includsion of this play as the final chapter of the book, the story of Brad finds its final home. . . . Wolcott's work, in all its complexity and controversy is now offered to a new generation of qualitative researchers and fieldworkers. This intriguing, compelling work is a touching depiciton fo the struggles of a research amid the complexitites of a new and advancing field of research. (Audrey M. Dentith, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee <i>Columbia Record</i>)<br><br>Wolcott is a well-known, iconoclastic anthropologist of education. . . . He provides a detailed, explicit, autobiographical account of the events surrounding the publication of a series of articles on educational inadequacy, subsequently labeled 'The Brad Trilogy.' It tells the story behind the trilogy, examining personal, professional, and moral issues raised by the author's romantic relationship with the middle-class homeless man whose story is told in the trilogy. The book chronicles the young man's struggle with mental illness and Wolcott's subsequent encounters with family members, the mental health establishment, the justice system, and the academic world, presenting a firsthand account of the failure of schools, communities, mental health providers, welfare agencies and courts to serve those in need. (J. Armstrong, University of New Mexico <i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>This volume is well written and it raises a number of interesting issues, not only about research methods, but also about education, mental health, and the criminal justice system...it is sure to serve as a catalyst for a number of vigorous discussions about ethics and intimacy in the research process. (Amanda Lewis, University of Illinois <i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)<br><br>This book is well-written, compelling and enjoyable...Not everyone will agree with Wolcott's conclusions about research and ethics. But that is precisely the point. This book can be used very productively in classes in which the ethics of field research is a topic. It will generate a lot of discussion and debate. (Don Kulick, New York University (USA) <i>Sexualities: Studies in Culture and Society</i>)<br><br>Harry pursues difficult goals with lively style, provocative scholarship, and admirable collegiality. . . . This is a book I've long encouraged him to write because of the importance of the questions about educational adequacy and the necessary distinctions of education and schooling. The inadequacy of our institutions of schooling, justice, and welfare is an important expansion of the original agenda.

Oriented toward traditional black and white photography, the book also explores color, digital techniques and equipment, camera and camera accessories use, the exposure and development of film, and the making and finishing of prints. All aspects of the process are explained and illustrated clearly in two-page spreads, each of which address a self-contained topic. <b> </b> Chapter topics include how to get started; how to make prints better; types of lenses, film, lighting, and filters; selecting shutter speed and points of view; and how to cover subjects such as people and landscapes. <b> </b> For anyone who knows nothing about photography but would like to learn, or just wants to take and make better pictures. </p></p><p>Preface <p> If you don't know anything about photography and would like to learn, or if you want to make better pictures than ones you make now, A Short Course in Photography will help you. It presents in depth the basic techniques for black-and-white photography:</p><p>How to get a good exposure How to adjust the focus, shutter speed, and aperture (the size of the lens opening) to produce the results you want How to develop film and make prints </p><p> Most of today's cameras incorporate automatic features, but that doesn't mean that they automatically produce the results you want. A Short Course in Photography devotes special attention to:</p><p>Automatic focus and automatic exposure&#x2014;what they do and, particularly, how to override them when it is better to adjust the camera manually </p><p> Some of the book's highlights include:</p><p>Getting Started. If you are brand new to photography, this section will walk you through the first steps of selecting and loading film, focusing sharply, adjusting the exposure, and making your first pictures. See pages 4-9. Digital Imaging. In one sense, digital imaging is just another tool, but it is also an immensely powerful technique that is changing photography and that will empower those who know how to use it. See pages 152-155. Projects. These projects are designed to help you develop your technical and expressive skills. See, for example, page 128 or 171. Making Better Prints. Additional information about how to fine tune your prints by burning in and dodging (darkening or lightening selected areas), and by cropping the edges to concentrate attention on the portion of the scene you want. See pages 114-117. Types of lenses, types of film, lighting, filters </p><p> Photography is a subjective and personal undertaking. A Short Course in Photography emphasizes your choices in picture making:</p><p>How to look at a scene in terms of the way the camera can record it How to select the shutter speed, point of view, or other elements that can make the difference between an ordinary snapshot and an exciting photograph Chapter 9, Seeing Like a Camera, explores your choices in selecting and adjusting the image, and covers how to photograph subjects such as people and landscapes </p><p> New to this edition are:</p><p>Photography on the Internet. How to find manufacturer's data, photographs, and other useful information on the World Wide Web More information on Health and Safety precautions in the darkroom Technical updates throughout Many new photographs and illustrations </p><p> This book is designed to make learning photography as easy as possible:</p><p>Every two facing pages completes a single topic Detailed step-by-step instructions clarify each stage of extended procedures such as negative development and printing Boldfaced headings make subtopics easy to spot Numerous photographs and drawings illustrate each topic </p><p> Acknowledgments<br> </p><p> Many people gave generously of their time and effort in the production of this book.

Based on collations of the two issues and the two impressions of the single edition publishing in Melville's lifetime, it incorporates necessary emendations made by the series editors. This text of <i>Pierre</i> is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).<br></p><p>This Kraken Edition of Pierre, or The Ambiguities is a reconstruction of the text that Melville delivered to Harper &amp; Brothers early in January 1852, just as some of the most devastating reviews of Moby-Dick were appearing. The Harper brothers apparently decided that Pierre was even more outrageous than Moby-Dick and tried to avoid publishing it by offering Melville less than half the royalties they had paid for his previous books. Accepting the humiliating contract, Melville took a self-destructive revenge. After Book XVI, he interpolated a new section on "Young America in Literature", in which he arbitrarily announced that his hero, Pierre, had been a juvenile author. Melville proceeded to add an intrusive "Pierre as author" sub-plot, disparaging American literary life and the world of publishing, which he left unassimilated into the book he had first completed. Melville scholar Hershel Parker has long believed that the psychological stature of Moby-Dick would best be understood in the light of the original, shorter version of Pierre, in his opinion "surely the finest psychological novel anyone had yet written in English". Moby-Dick and the reconstructed Pierre are at last revealed as complexly interlinked companion studies of the moods of thought - the Typee and Omoo of depth psychology. Furthermore, all Melville lovers will be challenged by Maurice Sendak's extraordinary pictures, which constitute a brilliantly provocative interpretation of Melville's study of moral and mental ambiguities.<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 &#x2013; September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>Infectious Ideas: Contagion in Premodern Islamic and Christian Thought in the Western Mediterranean</h2><p><p><i>Infectious Ideas</i> is a comparative analysis of how Muslim and Christian scholars explained the transmission of disease in the premodern Mediterranean world.</p><p>How did religious communities respond to and make sense of epidemic disease? To answer this, historian Justin K. Stearns looks at how Muslim and Christian communities conceived of contagion, focusing especially on the Iberian Peninsula in the aftermath of the Black Death. What Stearns discovers calls into question recent scholarship on Muslim and Christian reactions to the plague and leprosy. </p><p>Stearns shows that rather than universally reject the concept of contagion, as most scholars have affirmed, Muslim scholars engaged in creative and rational attempts to understand it. He explores how Christian scholars used the metaphor of contagion to define proper and safe interactions with heretics, Jews, and Muslims, and how contagion itself denoted phenomena as distinct as the evil eye and the effects of corrupted air. Stearns argues that at the heart of the work of both Muslims and Christians, although their approaches differed, was a desire to protect the physical and spiritual health of their respective communities.</p><p>Based on Stearns's analysis of Muslim and Christian legal, theological, historical, and medical texts in Arabic, Medieval Castilian, and Latin, <i>Infectious Ideas</i> is the first book to offer a comparative discussion of concepts of contagion in the premodern Mediterranean world.</p></p><p><p><b>Justin K. Stearns</b> is an assistant professor in the Arab Crossroads Studies Program at New York University&#x2013;Abu Dhabi.</p><p>"A welcome addition to the growing literature on plague&#x2015;and medical thought&#x2015;in the premodern Islamic world. Stearns's translations add new voices to those already known, and approach known figures with subtlety and nuance, challenging or at least refining the conclusions of the established scholarship... Stearns has provided future students commanding the requisite skills and depth of vision both a model and a solid target."</p> (Joseph P. Byrne <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Provides readers not only with a fascinating, beautifully researched account of contagion and plague in the premodern Western Mediterranean, but also with a series of thought-provoking new approaches to religious exegesis, legal interpretation, and literary production, and a set of methodological models that should serve scholars in the fields far beyond the realm of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century studies of illness and health in the Maghrib. The book is a fascinating read."</p> (Ruth A.

Both new and experienced teachers will be grateful to have so much material to choose from. This is an eminently practical book-the directions are clear, the drawings delightful and the keys singable. But what truly distinguishes this book from similar collections is the author&#39;s point of view. Drawing from her remarkable family experience and her many years as a Waldorf teacher, Anna Rainville comes to the enterprise with much love and wisdom. Her insightful and eloquent comments sing forth her firsthand delight in these games and ring with insight into the gifts of the material. She deeply understands the importance of these playful rituals as a way to bring the child&#39;s inner and outer life into accord and equally values their power to create a circle of community. In an age when children&#39;s play has been reduced to electronic sensation and organized athletics, a book like this is needed indeed to remind us of an older and truer form of childhood play.</p><p>Anna Rainville has been teaching in public and Waldorf schools for nearly thirty years and has been singing and dancing for more than that. Particularly dedicated to early childhood education, she brings great joy and inspiration to workshops for adults in this field.</p><h2>Animals That Ought to Be: Poems About Imaginary Pets</h2><p>In these imaginative poems you'll find animals that nobody has ever hear of-but that certainly ought to exist. <p>Each poem in this collection is paired with a striking painting by renowned artist, Leonard Baskin, and will inspire young readers to invent their own animals that ought to be.</p></p><p>Baskin and Michelson, who collaborated very effectively on the earlier Did You Say Ghosts?, have created a dozen creepy--but helpful--creatures, including the Nightmare Scarer, which eats bad dreams; and the Channel Changer, which gives a new meaning to the term "belly button." <i>(Ages 5 to 8)</i>Richard Michelson is a prize-winning poet whose works appear in numerous anthologies, including The Norton Introduction to Poetry and Blood to Remember: American Poets of the Holocaust. His collection Tap Dancing for the Relatives was praised by Elie Wiesel as &#34;deeply moving.&#34; He is also the author of the children&#39;s book, Grandpa&#39;s Gamble (Cavendish Children&#39;s Books, 1999). The owner of R. Michelson Galleries, he lives with his family in Amherst, Massachusetts</p><h2>Factor Analysis, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Comprehensive and comprehensible, this classic covers the basic and advanced topics essential for using factor analysis as a scientific tool in psychology, education, sociology, and related areas. Emphasizing the usefulness of the techniques, it presents sufficient mathematical background for understanding and sufficient discussion of applications for effective use.

I put it in my backpack along with Mrs. Talbot's magazine and went outside to untie Stitch.<br><br>He had pulled his leash out as far as it would go and was sitting around the corner, half-strangled, watching a robin. Stitch never barks, not even at birds. He didn't even yip when Dad stitched up his paw. He just sat there the way we found him on the front porch, shivering a little and holding his paw up for Dad to look at. Mrs. Talbot says he's a terrible watchdog, but I'm glad he doesn't bark. Rusty barked all the time and look where it got him.<br><br>I had to pull Stitch back around the corner to where I could get enough slack to untie him. That took some doing because he really liked that robin. "It's a sign of spring, isn't it, fella?" I said, trying to get at the knot with my fingernails. I didn't loosen the knot, but I managed to break one of my fingernails off to the quick. Great. Mom will demand to know if I've noticed any other fingernails breaking.<br><br>My hands are a real mess. This winter I've gotten about a hundred burns on the back of my hands from that stupid woodstove of ours. One spot, just above my wrist, I keep burning over and over so it never has a chance to heal. The stove isn't big enough and when I try to jam a log in that's too long that same spot hits the inside of the stove every time. My stupid brother David won't saw them off to the right length. I've asked him and asked him to please cut them shorter, but he doesn't pay any attention to me.<br><br>I asked Mom if she would please tell him not to saw the logs so long, but she didn't. She never criticizes David. As far as she's concerned he can't do anything wrong just because he's twenty-three and was married.<br><br>"He does it on purpose," I told her. "He's hoping I'll burn to death."<br><br>"Paranoia is the number-one killer of fourteen-year-old girls," Mom said. She always says that. It makes me so mad I feel like killing her. "He doesn't do it on purpose. You need to be more careful with the stove, that's all." But all the time she was holding my hand and looking at the big burn that won't heal like it was a time bomb set to go off.<br><br>"We need a bigger stove," I said, and yanked my hand away. We do need a bigger one. Dad closed up the fireplace and put the woodstove in when the gas bill was getting out of sight, but it's just a little one because Mom didn't want one that would stick way out in the living room. Anyway, we were only going to use it in the evenings.<br><br>We won't get a new one. They are all too busy working on the stupid greenhouse. Maybe spring will come early, and my hand will have half a chance to heal. I know better. Last winter the snow kept up till the middle of June and this is only March. Stitch's robin is going to freeze his little tail if he doesn't head back south. Dad says that last year was unusual, that the weather will be back to normal this year, but he doesn't believe it, either, or he wouldn't be building the greenhouse.<br><br>As soon as I let go of Stitch's leash, he backed around the corner like a good boy and sat there waiting for me to stop sucking my finger and untie him. "We'd better get a move on," I told him. "Mom'll have a fit." I was supposed to go by the general store to try and get some tomato seeds, but the sun was already pretty far west, and I had at least a half hour's walk home. If I got home after dark I'd get sent to bed without supper and then I wouldn't get to read the letter. Besides, if I didn't go to the general store today they would have to let me go tomorrow and I wouldn't have to work on the stupid greenhouse.<br><br>Sometimes I feel like blowing it up. There's sawdust and mud on everything, and David dropped one of the pieces of plastic on the stove while they were cutting it and it melted onto the stove and stinks to high heaven. But nobody else even notices the mess, they're so busy talking about how wonderful it's going to be to have homegrown watermelon and corn and tomatoes next summer.<br><br>I don't see how it's going to be any different from last summer. The only things that came up at all were the lettuce and the potatoes. The lettuce was about as tall as my broken fingernail and the potatoes were as hard as rocks. Mrs. Talbot said it was the altitude, but Dad said it wasn't, either, it was the funny weather and this crummy Pikes Peak granite that passes for soil around here. He went up to the little library in the back of the general store and got a do-it-yourself book on greenhouses and started tearing everything up and now even Mrs. Talbot is crazy about the idea.<br><br>The other day I told them, "Paranoia is the number-one killer of people at this altitude," but they were too busy cutting slats and stapling plastic to even pay any attention to me.<br><br>Stitch walked along ahead of me, straining at his leash, and as soon as we were across the highway, I took it off. He never runs away like Rusty used to. Anyway, it's impossible to keep him out of the road, and the times I've tried keeping him on his leash, he dragged me out into the middle and I got in trouble with Dad over leaving footprints. So I keep to the frozen edges of the road, and he moseys along, stopping to sniff at potholes, and when he gets behind, I whistle at him and he comes running right up.<br><br>I walked pretty fast. It was getting chilly out, and I'd only worn my sweater. I stopped at the top of the hill and whistled at Stitch. We still had a mile to go. I could see the Peak from where I was standing. Maybe Dad is right about spring coming. There was hardly any snow on the Peak, and the burned part didn't look quite as dark as it did last fall, like maybe the trees are coming back.<br><br>Last year at this time the whole peak was solid white. I remember because that was when Dad and David and Mr. Talbot went hunting and it snowed every day and they didn't get back for almost a month. Mom just about went crazy before they got back. She kept going up to the road to watch for them even though the snow was five feet deep and she was leaving footprints as big as the Abominable Snowman's. She took Rusty with her even though he hated the snow about as much as Stitch hates the dark. And she took a gun. One time she tripped over a branch and fell down in the snow. She sprained her ankle and was frozen stiff by the time she made it back to the house. I felt like saying, "Paranoia is the number-one killer of mothers," but Mrs. Talbot butted in and said the next time I had to go with her and how this was what happened when people were allowed to go places by themselves, which meant me going to the post office. And I said I could take care of myself and Mom told me not to be rude to Mrs. Talbot and Mrs. Talbot was right, I should go with her the next time.<br><br>Mom wouldn't wait till her ankle was better. She bandaged it up and we went the very next day. She wouldn't say a word the whole trip, just limped through the snow. She never even looked up till we got to the road. The snow had stopped for a little while and the clouds had lifted enough so you could see the Peak. It was really neat, like a black and white photograph, the gray sky and the black trees and the white mountain. The Peak was completely covered with snow. You couldn't make out the toll road at all.<br><br>We were supposed to hike up the Peak with the Clearys.<br><br>When we got back to the house, I said, "The summer before last the Clearys never came."<br><br>Mom took off her mittens and stood by the stove, pulling off chunks of frozen snow. "Of course they didn't come, Lynn," she said.<br><br>Snow from my coat was dripping onto the stove and sizzling. "I didn't mean that," I said. "They were supposed to come the first week in June. Right after Rick graduated. So what happened? Did they just decide not to come or what?"<br><br>"I don't know," she said, pulling off her hat and shaking her hair out. Her bangs were all wet.<br><br>"Maybe they wrote to tell you they'd changed their plans," Mrs. Talbot said. "Maybe the post office lost the letter."<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Mom said.<br><br>"You'd think they'd have written or something," I said.<br><br>"Maybe the post office put the letter in somebody else's box," Mrs. Talbot said.<br><br>"It doesn't matter," Mom said, and went to hang her coat over the line in the kitchen. She wouldn't say another word about them. When Dad got home I asked him about the Clearys, too, but he was too busy telling about the trip to pay any attention to me.<br><br>Stitch didn't come. I whistled again and then started back after him. He was all the way at the bottom of the hill, his nose buried in something. "Come on," I said, and he turned around and then I could see why he hadn't come. He'd gotten himself tangled up in one of the electric wires that was down. He'd managed to get the cable wound around his legs like he does his leash sometimes and the harder he tried to get out, the more he got tangled up.<br><br>He was right in the middle of the road. I stood on the edge of the road, trying to figure out a way to get to him without leaving footprints. The road was pretty much frozen at the top of the hill, but down here snow was still melting and running across the road in big rivers. I put my toe out into the mud, and my sneaker sank in a good half inch, so I backed up, rubbed out the toe print with my hand, and wiped my hand on my jeans. I tried to think what to do. Dad is as paranoiac about footprints as Mom is about my hands, but he is even worse about my being out after dark. If I didn't make it back in time he might even tell me I couldn't go to the post office anymore.<br><br>Stitch was coming as close as he ever would to barking. He'd gotten the wire around his neck and was choking himself. "All right," I said, "I'm coming." I jumped out as far as I could into one of the rivers and then waded the rest of the way to Stitch, looking back a couple of times to make sure the water was washing away the footprints.<br><br>I unwound Stitch like you would a spool of thread, and threw the loose end of the wire over to the side of the road where it dangled from the pole, all ready to hang Stitch next time he comes along.<br><br>"You stupid dog," I said. "Now hurry!" and I sprinted back to the side of the road and up the hill in my sopping wet sneakers. He ran about five steps and stopped to sniff at a tree. "Come on!" I said. "It's getting dark. Dark!"<br><br>He was past me like a shot and halfway down the hill. Stitch is afraid of the dark. I know, there's no such thing in dogs. But Stitch really is. Usually I tell him, "Paranoia is the number-one killer of dogs," but right now I wanted him to hurry before my feet started to freeze. I started running, and we got to the bottom of the hill about the same time.<br><br>Stitch stopped at the driveway of the Talbots' house. Our house wasn't more than a few hundred feet from where I was standing, on the other side of the hill. Our house is down in kind of a well formed by hills on all sides. It's so deep and hidden you'd never even know it's there. You can't even see the smoke from our woodstove over the top of the Talbots' hill. There's a shortcut through the Talbots' property and down through the woods to our back door, but I don't take it anymore. "Dark, Stitch," I said sharply, and started running again. Stitch kept right at my heels.<br><br>The Peak was turning pink by the time I got to our driveway. Stitch peed on the spruce tree about a hundred times before I got it dragged back across the dirt driveway. It's a real big tree. Last summer Dad and David chopped it down and then made it look like it had fallen across the road. It completely covers up where the driveway meets the road, but the trunk is full of splinters, and I scraped my hand right in the same place as always. Great.<br><br>I made sure Stitch and I hadn't left any marks on the road (except for the marks he always leaves--another dog could find us in a minute. That's probably how Stitch showed up on our front porch, he smelled Rusty) and then got under cover of the hill as fast as I could. Stitch isn't the only one who gets nervous after dark. And besides, my feet were starting to hurt. Stitch was really paranoiac tonight. He didn't even take off running after we were in sight of the house.<br><br>David was outside, bringing in a load of wood. I could tell just by looking at it that they were all the wrong length. "Cutting it kind of close, aren't you?" he said. "Did you get the tomato seeds?"<br><br>"No," I said. "I brought you something else, though. I brought everybody something."<br><br>I went on in. Dad was rolling out plastic on the living room floor. Mrs. Talbot was holding one end for him. Mom was standing holding the card table, still folded up, waiting for them to finish so she could set it up in front of the stove for supper. Nobody even looked up. I unslung my backpack and took out Mrs. Talbot's magazine and the letter.</p><h2>Fifty Great American Short Stories</h2><p><b>A brilliant, far-reaching collection of stories from Washington Irving to John Updike.</b><br> <b><br> The Classic Stories<br> </b>Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s <i>Ms. Found in a Bottle</i>&nbsp;<br>Bret Harte&#x2019;s <i>The Outcasts of Poker Flat</i>&nbsp;<br>Sherwood Anderson&#x2019;s <i>Death in the Woods</i><br> Stephen Vincent Ben�t&#x2019;s <i>By the Waters of Babylon</i><b><br><br> The Great Writers<br> </b>Melville <br>James <br>Dreiser <br>Faulkner <br>Hemingway <br>Steinbeck<br>McCullers<br><br><b> The Little-Known Masterpieces<br> </b>Edith Wharton&#x2019;s <i>The Dilettante<br></i>Finley Peter Dunne&#x2019;s <i>Mr. Dooley on the Popularity of Fireman<br></i>Charles M.

The lightning gleamed, and the loud claps of thunder rattled through the lofty narrow streets&#x2014;but I should first tell you something about this young German.<br><br>Gottfried Wolfgang was a young man of good family. He had studied for some time at Gottingen, but being of a visionary and enthusiastic character, he had wandered into those wild and speculative doctrines which have so often bewildered German students. His secluded life, his intense application, and the singular nature of his studies, had an effect on both mind and body. His health was impaired; his imagination diseased. He had been indulging in fanciful speculations on spiritual essences, until, like Swedenborg, he had an ideal world of his own around him. He took up a notion, I do not know from what cause, that there was an evil influence hanging over him; an evil genius or spirit seeking to ensnare him and ensure his perdition. Such an idea working on his melancholy temperament produced the most gloomy effects. He became haggard and desponding. His friends discovered the mental malady preying upon him, and determined that the best cure was a change of scene; he was sent, therefore, to finish his studies amidst the splendors and gayeties of Paris.<br><br>Wolfgang arrived at Paris at the breaking out of the revolution. The popular delirium at first caught his enthusiastic mind, and he was captivated by the political and philosophical theories of the day: but the scenes of blood which followed shocked his sensitive nature, disgusted him with society and the world, and made him more than ever a recluse. He shut himself up in a solitary apartment in the Pays Latin, the quarter of students. There, in a gloomy street not far from the monastic walls of the Sorbonne, he pursued his favorite speculations. Sometimes he spent hours together in the great libraries of Paris, those catacombs of departed authors, rummaging among their hoards of dusty and obsolete works in quest of food for his unhealthy appetite. He was, in a manner, a literary ghoul, feeding in the charnel-house of decayed literature.<br><br>Wolfgang, though solitary and recluse, was of an ardent temperament, but for a time it operated merely upon his imagination. He was too shy and ignorant of the world to make any advances to the fair, but he was a passionate admirer of female beauty, and in his lonely chamber would often lose himself in reveries on forms and faces which he had seen, and his fancy would deck out images of loveliness far surpassing the reality.<br><br>While his mind was in this excited and sublimated state, a dream produced an extraordinary effect upon him. It was of a female face of transcendent beauty. So strong was the impression made, that he dreamt of it again and again. It haunted his thoughts by day, his slumbers by night; in fine, he became passionately enamoured of this shadow of a dream. This lasted so long that it became one of those fixed ideas which haunt the minds of melancholy men, and are at times mistaken for madness.<br><br>Such was Gottfried Wolfgang, and such his situation at the time I mentioned. He was returning home late one stormy night, through some of the old and gloomy streets of the Marais, the ancient part of Paris. The loud claps of thunder rattled among the high houses of the narrow streets. He came to the Place de Greve, the square, where public executions are performed. The lightning quivered about the pinnacles of the ancient Hotel de Ville, and shed flickering gleams over the open space in front. As Wolfgang was crossing the square, he shrank back with horror at finding himself close by the guillotine. It was the height of the reign of terror, when this dreadful instrument of death stood ever ready, and its scaffold was continually running with the blood of the virtuous and the brave. It had that very day been actively employed in the work of carnage, and there it stood in grim array, amidst a silent and sleeping city, waiting for fresh victims.<br><br>Wolfgang's heart sickened within him, and he was turning shuddering from the horrible engine, when he beheld a shadowy form, cowering as it were at the foot of the steps which led up to the scaffold. A succession of vivid flashes of lightning revealed it more distinctly. It was a female figure, dressed in black. She was seated on one of the lower steps of the scaffold, leaning forward, her face hid in her lap; and her long dishevelled tresses hanging to the ground, streaming with the rain which fell in torrents. Wolfgang paused. There was something awful in this solitary monument of woe. The female had the appearance of being above the common order. He knew the times to be full of vicissitude, and that many a fair head, which had once been pillowed on down, now wandered houseless. Perhaps this was some poor mourner whom the dreadful axe had rendered desolate, and who sat here heart-broken on the strand of existence, from which all that was dear to her had been launched into eternity.<br><br>He approached, and addressed her in the accents of sympathy. She raised her head and gazed wildly at him. What was his astonishment at beholding, by the bright glare of the lightning, the very face which had haunted him in his dreams. It was pale and disconsolate, but ravishingly beautiful.<br>Trembling with violent and conflicting emotions, Wolfgang again accosted her. He spoke something of her being exposed at such an hour of the night, and to the fury of such a storm, and offered to conduct her to her friends. She pointed to the guillotine with a gesture of dreadful signification.<br><br>"I have no friend on earth!" said she.<br><br>"But you have a home," said Wolfgang.<br><br>"Yes&#x2014;in the grave!"<br><br>The heart of the student melted at the words.<br><br>"If a stranger dare make an offer," said he, "without danger of being misunderstood, I would offer my humble dwelling as a shelter; myself as a devoted friend. I am friendless myself in Paris, and a stranger in the land; but if my life could be of service, it is at your disposal, and should be sacrificed before harm or indignity should come to you."<br><br>There was an honest earnestness in the young man's manner that had its effect. His foreign accent, too, was in his favor; it showed him not to be a hackneyed inhabitant of Paris. Indeed, there is an eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted. The homeless stranger confided herself implicitly to the protection of the student.<br><br>He supported her faltering steps across the Pont Neuf, and by the place where the statue of Henry the Fourth had been overthrown by the populace. The storm had abated, and the thunder rumbled at a distance. All Paris was quiet; that great volcano of human passion slumbered for a while, to gather fresh strength for the next day's eruption. The student conducted his charge through the ancient streets of the Pays Latin, and by the dusky walls of the Sorbonne, to the great dingy hotel which he inhabited. The old portress who admitted them stared with surprise at the unusual sight of the melancholy Wolfgang, with a female companion.<br><br>On entering his apartment, the student, for the first time, blushed at the scantiness and indifference of his dwelling. He had but one chamber&#x2014;an old-fashioned saloon&#x2014;heavily carved, and fantastically furnished with the remains of former magnificence, for it was one of those hotels in the quarter of the Luxembourg palace, which had once belonged to nobility. It was lumbered with books and papers, and all the usual apparatus of a student, and his bed stood in a recess at one end.<br><br>When lights were brought, and Wolfgang had a better opportunity of contemplating the stranger, he was more than ever intoxicated by her beauty. Her face was pale, but of a dazzling fairness, set off by a profusion of raven hair that hung clustering about it. Her eyes were large and brilliant, with a singular expression approaching almost to wildness. As far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen, it was of perfect symmetry. Her whole appearance was highly striking, though she was dressed in the simplest style. The only thing approaching to an ornament which she wore, was a broad black band round her neck, clasped by diamonds.<br><br>The perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the helpless being thus thrown upon his protection. He thought of abandoning his chamber to her, and seeking shelter for himself elsewhere. Still he was so fascinated by her charms, there seemed to be such a spell upon his thoughts and senses, that he could not tear himself from her presence. Her manner, too, was singular and unaccountable. She spoke no more of the guillotine. Her grief had abated. The attentions of the student had first won her confidence. and then, apparently, her heart. She was evidently an enthusiast like himself, and enthusiasts soon understand each other.<br><br>In the infatuation of the moment, Wolfgang avowed his passion for her. He told her the story of his mysterious dream, and how she had possessed his heart before he had even seen her. She was strangely affected by his recital, and acknowledged to have felt an impulse towards him equally unaccountable. It was the time for wild theory and wild actions. Old prejudices and superstitions were done away; everything was under the sway of the "Goddess of Reason." Among other rubbish of the old times, the forms and ceremonies of marriage began to be considered superfluous bonds for honorable minds. Social compacts were the vogue. Wolfgang was too much of a theorist not to be tainted by the liberal doctrines of the day.<br><br>"Why should we separate?" said he: "our hearts are united; in the eye of reason and honor we are as one. What need is there of sordid forms to bind high souls together?"<br><br>The stranger listened with emotion: she had evidently received illumination at the same school.<br><br>"You have no home nor family," continued he; "let me be everything to you, or rather let us be everything to one another. If form is necessary, form shall be observed&#x2014;there is my hand. I pledge myself to you forever."<br><br>"Forever?" said the stranger, solemnly.<br><br>"Forever!" repeated Wolfgang.<br><br>The stranger clasped the hand extended to her: "Then I am yours," murmured she, and sank upon his bosom.<br><br>The next morning the student left his bride sleeping, and sallied forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments suitable to the change in his situation. When he returned, he found the stranger lying with her head hanging over the bed, and one arm thrown over it. He spoke to her, but received no reply. He advanced to awaken her from her uneasy posture. On taking her hand, it was cold&#x2014;there was no pulsation&#x2014;her face was pallid and ghastly. In a word, she was a corpse.<br>Horrified and frantic, he alarmed the house. A scene of confusion ensued. The police was summoned. As the officer of police entered the room, he started back on beholding the corpse.<br><br>"Great heaven!" cried he, "how did this woman come here?"<br><br>"Do you know anything about her?" said Wolfgang eagerly.<br><br>"Do I?" exclaimed the officer: "she was guillotined yesterday."<br><br>He stepped forward; undid the black collar round the neck of the corpse, and the head rolled on the floor!<br><br>The student burst into a frenzy. "The fiend! the fiend has gained possession of me!" shrieked he; "I am lost forever."<br><br>They tried to soothe him, but in vain. He was possessed with the frightful belief that an evil spirit had reanimated the dead body to ensnare him. He went distracted, and died in a mad-house.<br><br>Here the old gentleman with the haunted head finished his narrative.<br><br>"And is this really a fact?" said the inquisitive gentleman.<br><br>"A fact not to be doubted," replied the other. "I had it from the best authority. The student told it me himself. I saw him in a mad-house in Paris."<br><br><i>Young Goodman Brown<br>by Nathaniel Hawthorne</i><br>YOUNG GOODMAN Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown.<br><br>"Dearest heart," whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear, "prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year."<br><br>"My love and my Faith," replied young Goodman Brown, "of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My journey, as thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done 'twixt now and sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"<br><br>"Then God bless you!" said Faith, with the pink ribbons; "and may you find all well when you come back."<br><br>"Amen!" cried Goodman Brown. "Say thy prayers, dear Faith, and go to bed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee."<br><br>So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until, being about to turn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the head of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of her pink ribbons.<br><br>"Poor little Faith!" thought he, for his heart smote him.

To Berger&#x2019;s utter shock, the elk ignored the wolves as they went in for the kill. The brutal attack that followed&#x2014;swift and bloody&#x2014;led Berger to hypothesize that after only six decades, the elk had forgotten to fear a species that had survived by eating them for hundreds of millennia.<br><br> Berger&#x2019;s fieldwork that frigid day raised important questions that would require years of travel and research to answer: Can naive animals avoid extinction when they encounter reintroduced carnivores? To what extent is fear culturally transmitted? And how can a better understanding of current predator-prey behavior help demystify past extinctions and inform future conservation?<br><br><i>The Better to Eat You With</i> is the chronicle of Berger&#x2019;s search for answers.&nbsp; From Yellowstone&#x2019;s elk and wolves to rhinos living with African lions and moose coexisting with tigers and bears in Asia, Berger tracks cultures of fear in animals across continents and climates, engaging readers with a stimulating combination of natural history, personal experience, and conservation. Whether battling bureaucracy in the statehouse or fighting subzero wind chills in the field, Berger puts himself in the middle of the action.&nbsp; <i>The Better to Eat You With</i> invites readers to join him there. The thrilling tales he tells reveal a great deal not only about survival in the animal kingdom but also the process of doing science in foreboding conditions and hostile environments.</p><p><b>Joel Berger</b> is John J. Craighead Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Montana and senior scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society. He is coauthor of <i>Horn of Darkness </i>and author of <i>Wild Horses of the Great Basin, </i>the latter published by the University of Chicago Press."When ecologist Berger&nbsp;noticed that elk in Yellowstone were no longer afraid of wolves, who had been absent from the ecosystem for 60 years, it sparked a quest to answer three major questions: Can naive prey avoid extinction when their predators are reintroduced? To what extent can animals learn fear? And what can current behavior teach us about past extinctions and future conservation efforts? We follow Berger as he attempts to answer these questions by radio-collaring moose in below-zero temperatures in Grand Teton National Park and comparing how bison mothers in areas with wolves, areas without wolves, and areas with new wolf packs react to wolf calls. . . .The excitement and drudgery of fieldwork, combined with the author&#x2019;s discoveries on how fear of predators changes the behavior of their prey, make for a book that teaches and thrills equally." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Berger reports solid scientific information then goes beyond it in an extraordinary effort to understand animal fear and its role in survival and reproduction.&nbsp;The result is a&nbsp;luminous account of animal individuality and emotion." (Barbara J. King <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Berger&#x2019;s research involved majestic hardships and eccentric practices that included pitching carnivore dung baseball-style at browsing moose to see if they responded to the scent. He is the hairy-arsed action-man academic whose experience comes not from the lab but from the wild world. Culture is not something that divides us from the animal world: it is one more thing that links us." (Simon Barnes <i>Times (UK)</i> 2008-11-07)<br><br>"<i>The Better to Eat You With</i> builds upon the canon of important natural history literature that includes the writings of Leopold, the Muries, the Craigheads, George Shaller, E. O. Wilson, and Jacques Cousteau. . . . The book is that fine a read." (Tom Wilkinson <i>Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide</i> 2008-11-19)<br><br>"[The] extraordinary first-hand accounts of elk standing placidly as wolves approach in full view and promptly slaughter them make for gripping reading. They also have profound implications for programmes seeking to reintroduce top carnivores to habitats where they have long been absent. . . . A refreshing change from the dry and preachy tone often found in conservation books." (Luis Villazon <i>BBC Focus</i>)<br><br>"An informative, fun read." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Every once in a while, one encounters a book that does not simply drive the scholar to meditation upon diverse philosophical theories, but speaks to her very mode of being-in-the-world, her practice of being human. Every once in a long while, one reads a book that changes how we see the world. This is one of those rare books. As Berger so eloquently phrases his core message, 'the question is not about wild or captive, animal or human. It is about all of us--living beings together in one place, on a single planet.'" (Wendy C. Hamblet <i>Metapsychology</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The complex and nuanced interplay between predator and prey is an essential thread in the fabric of nature. Joel Berger&#x2019;s substantial contributions to this emerging world view have been rendered through simplicity and elegance&#x2014;by observing prey and their predators across global landscapes in a purposeful way. This book, delivered in the personalized style of a life&#x2019;s journey, tells an absorbing story of how big animals alter their behavior so as to manage the risk of being eaten.&#x201d;</p> (James A. Estes, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz)<br><br><p>&#x201c;How long do the ghosts of monsters linger before their misty essence evaporates? &nbsp;And when the monster itself (wolf, tiger, men) returns with meat hunger, how long before prey rediscover terror? What created the singular fleetness and visual acuity of pronghorn antelope? How necessary are predators and the fear of them in maintaining the resilience of wild places? Joel Berger has written a stirring adventure of wildness, prey naivet�, animal culture, and science.&#x201d;</p> (Michael Soul�, Research Professor Emeritus in Environmental Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>The Better to Eat You With</i> offers a very novel, important, and global view of the complex interrelationships between predators and prey. Science, culture, and practical issues meet head on, as they must, in a book that surely will change existing views about the role of fear in the evolution of behavior. Only world-renowned and indefatigable field biologist Joel Berger could pull off such a comprehensive analysis of how past and present must be studied as we try to figure out how all animals&#x2014;nonhuman and human&#x2014;will be able to share harmoniously our one and only planet in the future.

In the Irish Midlands, the Adirondacks of New York, the mining camps of New South Wales, and so many other places, these traveling men brought change&#x2014;to themselves and the families who later followed, to the women whose homes and communities they entered, and ultimately to the geography of Jewish history.</p><p><b>Hasia R.

Richly illustrated with case examples and session vignettes, the book addresses a variety of ways that clients may resist basic therapeutic procedures: noncompliance with agenda setting and homework assignments, splitting transference with other therapists, inappropriate behavior, and premature termination. Underlying processes of resistance are explored, from the desire for validation to risk aversion and self-handicapping. Also highlighted are ways that the therapist's own responses may inadvertently impede change. Provided are innovative tools for getting treatment back on track, including targeted interventions, in-session "experiments," and questionnaires and graphic models to share with clients.<br></p><p>Robert L.

Now 88, Geneen has teamed with Brent Bowers on <i>The Synergy Myth</i> to lay out his frank views on trendy "flavor-of-the-month" management philosophies, which are increasingly supplanting the old-fashioned values such as hard work and risk-taking that he favors.The man primarily responsible for making ITT into a wondrously profitable world-class conglomerate during the 1960s and early '70s offers pieces of his lively mind on contemporary business issues. Nearly 20 years after his official retirement, the 87-year-old Geneen (Managing, 1984) remains active in a host of commercial ventures to which he alludes frequently in his once-over-lightly critique of corporate America. Although the author created the archetypal ITT mainly through acquisitions (over 300 of them), he casts a decidedly cold eye on the merger mania of the 1990s. In particular, Geneen scoffs at the alchemic notion that there are worthwhile synergies to be gained from the unions of enterprises with variant competencies. ``If you mix beef broth, lemon juice, and flour, you don't get magic,'' he asserts, ``you get a mess.'' By contrast, the author argues, genuinely integrated conglomerates (like General Electric and the old ITT), which can achieve lucrative growth by capitalizing on opportunity, are an appreciably better deal for investors and the economy than holding companies built on a false organizational premise. Geneen also whales away at what he considers trendy oversight theories (reengineering, total quality control, et al.), the pious (albeit largely unavailing) actions taken in the name of corporate social responsibility, information-highway hype, rapacious lawyers, the intransigence of government bureaucrats, and the docility of all too many corporate directors. On the plus side of the ledger, he commends industriousness, taking calculated risks, worker empowerment, and inspirational leadership. So far as executive compensation is concerned, the author deems few if any rewards too great for those who enrich stockholders and share their hazards (i.e., by owning company securities). Provocative pronouncements from an unrepentent conglomerateur whose accomplishments and longevity have earned him elder-statesman status in the Global Village's business community. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This seminal book offers not only an answer regarding how to gain competitive advantage through people, but also a brand new, untapped human resource--psychological capital, or simply PsyCap. Generated from both the positive psychology movement and the authors&#39; pioneering work on positive organizational behavior, PsyCap goes beyond traditionally recognized human and social capital. But PsyCap is not a vague or unscientific concept: to be included in PsyCap, a given positive construct must be based on theory, research, and valid measurement, must be open to development, and must have measurable performance impact. The positive constructs that have been determined to best meet these PsyCap criteria, efficacy (confidence), hope, optimism, and resiliency, are covered in separate chapters in Psychological Capital. After exploring other potential positive constructs such as creativity, wisdom, well being, flow, humor, gratitude, forgiveness, emotional intelligence, spirituality, authenticity, and courage, the authors summarize the research demonstrating the performance impact of PsyCap. They go on to provide the PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ) as a measurement tool, and the PsyCap Intervention (PCI) as a development aid. Utility analysis indicates that investing in the development of PsyCap as presented in this book can result in a very substantial return. In total, Psychological Capital provides theory, research, measurements, and methods of application for the new resource of psychological capital, a resource that can be developed and sustained for competitive advantage.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Modern Communication Circuits (MCGRAW HILL SERIES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING)</h2><p>This text combines material from the traditional electronic circuits course with communications theory.

I became one of some 182,000 refugees from Soviet-dominated Hungary. My parents, though I was their only child, did not discourage me from leaving. They stayed up all night before I left, watching me as I wrote a few notes of farewell to relatives and friends and put a few belongings together for my escape from uncertainty to uncertainty. Emerging from the kitchen, my mother came around to stuff her freshly baked sweets--the best in the world--into my small backpack. "Look up Uncle Sanyi in New York," she said. At dawn, when it was time to say goodbye, my father tried to hold back his tears but he could not. "Write often," he said, his voice quavering with emotion. We embraced. We kissed. As I left, they stood on the small balcony of our Barcsay Street apartment and waved. I walked backwards as long as I could see them, hoping they could also see me for another few seconds. (As I recall this scene some fifty years later, holding back my tears as my father once tried to do, I still see them waving on the balcony, and I always will.)<br> I did not fully appreciate until much later--when I had my own children in America--how unselfish my parents were to let go of me."The 1956 Hungarian revolution, and its suppression by the U.S.S.R., was a key event in the cold war, demonstrating deep dissatisfaction with both the communist system and old-fashioned Soviet imperialism.

Despite his execution in Baghdad in 922 and the subsequent suppression of his work, Hallaj left an enduring literary and spiritual legacy that continues to inspire readers around the world. In <i>Hallaj</i>, Carl W. Ernst offers a definitive collection of 117 of Hallaj&#x2019;s poems expertly translated for contemporary readers interested in Middle Eastern and Sufi poetry and spirituality.<br><br> Ernst&#x2019;s fresh and direct translations reveal Hallaj&#x2019;s wide range of themes and genres, from courtly love poems to metaphysical reflections on union with God. In a fascinating introduction, Ernst traces Hallaj&#x2019;s dramatic story within classical Islamic civilization and early Arabic Sufi poetry. Setting himself apart by revealing Sufi secrets to the world, Hallaj was both celebrated and condemned for declaring: &#x201c;I am the Truth.&#x201d;<br><br> Expressing lyrics and ideas still heard in popular songs, the works of Hallaj remain vital and fresh even a thousand years after their composition. They reveal him as a master of spiritual poetry centuries before Rumi, who regarded Hallaj as a model. This unique collection makes it possible to appreciate the poems on their own, as part of the tragic legend of Hallaj, and as a formidable legacy of Middle Eastern culture.<br><br><i>The Global Humanities Translation Prize is awarded annually to a previously unpublished translation that strikes the delicate balance between scholarly rigor, aesthetic grace, and general readability, as judged by a rotating committee of Northwestern faculty, distinguished international scholars, writers, and public intellectuals.

A pioneering work of early feminism that extends to women the Enlightenment principle of "the rights of man," its argument remains as relevant today as it was for Woll-stonecraft's contemporaries. "Mary Wollstonecraft was not the first writer to call for women to receive a real, challenging education," writes Katha Pollitt in the new Introduction. "But she was the first to connect the education of women to the transformation of women's social position, of relations between the sexes, and even of society itself. She was the first to argue that women's intellectual equality would and should have actual consequences. The winds of change sweep through her pages."<br><br> This classic work of early feminism remains as relevant and passionate today as it was for Wollstonecraft's contemporaries. This edition includes new explanatory notes.</p><p>In this passionate reaction to Rousseau&#39;s pedagogical work Emile (1762) Wollstonecraft powerfully defends woman&#39;s ability to reason, given appropriate education. Her radical prescription was for girls to be educated alongside boys and to the same standard. Originally published in 1792, this is a foundational work of feminist political thought.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

As a consequence, he must deal with the oppressive mental anguish of being a criminal while attempting to maintain relationships with his friends and family.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</b> is considered one of the greatest novelists of all time. Born in Moscow in 1821, he began adulthood by resigning a commission as a military engineer to embark on a writing career. The praise he earned for his first novel, <i>Poor Folk, </i>immediately vaulted him to literary stardom. His political activity led to imprisonment, a mock execution, and exile to a Siberian prison camp, all of which shaped his later novels. Since his death in 1881, he has been best remembered for his novels <i>Crime and Punishment </i>and <i>The Brothers Karamazov. </i><br><br><b>Constance Garnett</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1946) was an English translator of nineteenth-century Russian literature.</p><h2>Questions and Rhetoric in the Greek New Testament: An Essential Reference Resource for Exegesis</h2><p><p>While there are almost 1000 questions in the Greek New Testament, many commentators, pastors, and students skip over the questions for more &#x2018;theological&#x2019; verses or worse they convert questions into statements to mine them for what they are saying theologically. However, this is not the way questions in the Greek New Testament work, and it overlooks the rhetorical importance of questions and how they were used in the ancient world.</p><p><em>Questions and Rhetoric in the Greek New Testament</em> is a helpful and thorough examination of questions in the Greek New Testament, seen from the standpoint of grammatical, semantic, and linguistic analysis, with special emphasis on their rhetorical effects. It includes charts, tools, and lists that explain and categorize the almost 1000 questions in the Greek New Testament. Thus, the user is able to go to the section in the book dealing with the type of question they are studying and find the exegetical parameters needed to understand that question.</p><p><em>Questions and Rhetoric in the Greek New Testament</em> offers vibrant examples of all the major categories of questions to aid the reader in grasping how questions work in the Greek New Testament. Special emphasis is given to the way questions persuade and influence readers of the Greek New Testament.</p></p><p><p>Douglas Estes is Assistant Professor of New Testament and Practical Theology and DMin Program Director at South University-Columbia. He received his PhD in Theology from the University of Nottingham, UK, and completed a Post Doc at the Dominican Biblical Institute. He has written or edited six books, as well as numerous essays, articles and reviews. He has served as an adjunct professor at Phoenix Seminary and Western Seminary, and has sixteen years of pastoral ministry experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Douglas Estes has written a very useful book. Not only will readers now see old questions in a new light, but they will also be prompted to ask new questions for the first time. The technical language and theoretical categories that drive the book are shown to have clear payoff in understanding the text of the New Testament in a new light. Especially interesting here are the case studies that conclude each section, where Estes shows us with great care and precision just how much is being asked by the different types of questions in the New Testament. -- George L. Parsenios, Associate Professor of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>Recognizing that questions are both central to ancient rhetoric and often overlooked in contemporary exegesis, Estes offers an expansive interdisciplinary treatment of questions in the Greek New Testament against the backdrop of grammatical theory, linguistics, and historiography, among other disciplines. He develops --- in much greater detail --- his previous research on the questions of Jesus in the Gospel of John, and in the process provides students, scholars, and pastors with an incredibly useful tool for exegetical research. Writing with the precision of an expert, the nuance of a skilled teacher, and the sensitivity of an exegete, Estes introduces the reader to the twenty-eight linguistic features of question asking, the four major formations of questions, and the thirty-six question types found within the NT. This impressive book represents an important achievement in the study of NT Greek and deserves to be among the required texts for advanced courses in Biblical Greek grammar. I cannot recommend this book highly enough! -- Christopher W. Skinner, Associate Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity, Loyola University Chicago<br><br>Questions are powerful rhetorical devices, but surprisingly they have not been the subject of rigorous scholarly examination --- until now. Estes, who has already established himself as an authority on the subject of questions in the Gospel of John (Brill, 2012), now extends his unique insights to the entire New Testament. Using a helpful taxonomic approach to the numerous questions in the Greek New Testament, Estes introduces his readers to the logic of questions in the text and their rhetorical effect, leading to a &#x201c;rounder&#x201d; reading of the New Testament. -- Cornelis Bennema, Senior Lecturer in New Testament and Academic Dean, Union School of Theology, UK<br><br>This is an exceptional book. It addresses an issue that most of us do not spend much time considering, namely, the questions of the New Testament. But questions give shape to the rhetoric of the text in ways we fail to appreciate, not to mention the fact that fifteen percent of the New Testament involves questions of various kinds. Estes writes with linguistic and academic savvy while remaining very clear, offering helpful examples and illustrations. If you have never questioned New Testament questions --- or even if you have --- this book will prove enormously useful. -- Constantine R. Campbell, Associate Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>Just as questions bear significant rhetorical import within our conventional discourses, they play crucial roles within written texts. While Christian preachers and teachers may have learned well how to do exegesis of declarative statements, the rhetorical and semantic implications of questions have often eluded them, with detriment to their teaching and preaching. A conspicuous vacancy in exegetical studies is filled with Questions and Rhetoric in the Greek New Testament, a thorough, even if not exhaustive, exegetical guide concerning the rhetoric and semantics of questions in the Greek New Testament. -- Ardel B. Caneday, Professor of New Testament and Greek, University of Northwestern --- St. Paul<br><br>I&#x2019;m delighted to see Douglas Estes deploy his considerable scholarly gifts and expertise in Greek rhetoric in this comprehensive yet accessible volume. This is a treasure trove for students and scholars alike. But I&#x2019;m especially excited for pastors and Bible teachers to have this resource at their fingertips in sermon and teaching preparation. A wonderful resource. -- Todd Wilson, Senior Pastor, Calvary Memorial Church</p><h2>Relational and Body-Centered Practices for Healing Trauma: Lifting the Burdens of the Past</h2><p><p><em>Relational and Body-Centered Practices for Healing Trauma</em> provides psychotherapists and other helping professionals with a new body-based clinical model for the treatment of trauma.

Taxes arouse strong passions, fueled not only by conflicts of economic self-interest, but by conflicting ideas of fairness. Taking as a guiding principle the conventional nature of private property, Murphy and Nagel show how taxes can only be evaluated as part of the overall system of property rights that they help to create. Justice or injustice in taxation, they argue, can only mean justice or injustice in the system of property rights and entitlements that result from a particular regime. Taking up ethical issues about individual liberty, interpersonal obligation, and both collective and personal responsibility, Murphy and Nagel force us to reconsider how our tax policy shapes our system of property rights.</p><p><br><strong>Liam Murphy</strong> teaches law and philosophy at New York University.

Authors John Szarkowski and Richard Benson have collected 100 photos taken between the years 1859 and 1956, all concerning some aspect of boats, boat building, and maritime life: the exuberance of a boat christening in 1900 and the eerie foreignness of arctic whalers in 1882, for example; shipwrecks and shipbuilders abound, and many of the photographs--those from the 19th century, especially--focus on the skin and bones of the trade, from the rotting shells of abandoned boats to the boilers and propellers of ships in the making.<p> The camera's subject might have been the sea, but the book is about so much more. Szarkowski, the former director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, has selected each of these photos as much for what they say about humanity's relationship to the sea as for the artistry of the pictures themselves. Richard Benson's commentary, meanwhile, speaks of technology, the futility of war, and the effects of mass production, as well as a wealth of information about maritime life. More than just a coffee-table book, <i>A Maritime Album</i> offers plenty of food for thought about the sea and the place it occupies in our lives and dreams.</p><i>A Maritime Album</i> is a book for coffee tables and collectors, a moving testimonial to the exaltation and apprehension of human interaction with the sea. In fishermen's parlance, it's a keeper. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, W. Jeffrey Bolster </i></p><h2>Insecure Majorities: Congress and the Perpetual Campaign</h2><p><p>As Democrats and Republicans continue to vie for political advantage, Congress remains paralyzed by partisan conflict. That the last two decades have seen some of the least productive Congresses in recent history is usually explained by the growing ideological gulf between the parties, but this explanation misses another fundamental factor influencing the dynamic. In contrast to politics through most of the twentieth century, the contemporary Democratic and Republican parties compete for control of Congress at relative parity, and this has dramatically changed the parties&#x2019; incentives and strategies in ways that have driven the contentious partisanship characteristic of contemporary American politics.<br> <br> With <i>Insecure Majorities,</i> Frances E. Lee offers a controversial new perspective on the rise of congressional party conflict, showing how the shift in competitive circumstances has had a profound impact on how Democrats and Republicans interact. For nearly half a century, Democrats were the majority party, usually maintaining control of the presidency, the House, and the Senate. Republicans did not stand much chance of winning majority status, and Democrats could not conceive of losing it. Under such uncompetitive conditions, scant collective action was exerted by either party toward building or preserving a majority. Beginning in the 1980s, that changed, and most elections since have offered the prospect of a change of party control. Lee shows, through an impressive range of interviews and analysis, how competition for control of the government drives members of both parties to participate in actions that promote their own party&#x2019;s image and undercut that of the opposition, including the perpetual hunt for issues that can score political points by putting the opposing party on the wrong side of public opinion. More often than not, this strategy stands in the way of productive bipartisan cooperation&#x2014;and it is also unlikely to change as long as control of the government remains within reach for both parties.<br> </p></p><p><b>Frances E. Lee</b> is professor in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland. She is the author of three books, most recently <i>Beyond Ideology: Politics, Principles, and Partisanship in the US Senate, </i>also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;With <i>Insecure Majorities,</i> Lee explores one of the most important questions for understanding American national politics today: how can we explain the emergence of the highly partisan contemporary Congress? With creativity and analytical rigor, she offers a compelling alternative to the conventional wisdom that increased ideological polarization has driven the conflict between the congressional parties. Lee argues instead that the &#x2018;struggle for institutional power&#x2019; increases incentives for highly partisan behavior and lowers incentives for legislating solutions.&#x201d; (Sarah Binder, George Washington University and the Brookings Institution)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Insecure Majorities</i> is a major contribution to our understanding of Congress and American national politics. Lee marshals an impressive array of evidence to convincingly argue that increasing ideological distance between the parties is not the only&#x2014;or even the most important&#x2014;factor driving the increased partisan conflict and changes in party strategy we have seen over the past three decades. Her cogent, engaging account of the nature of contemporary partisan conflict in Congress will be widely read and discussed beyond the field.&#x201d; (Tracy Sulkin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br><br>"I have great admiration for what Frances Lee has accomplished in <i>Insecure Majorities</i>. Her stimulating arguments and rich data will spark considerable theoretical debate and scholarly probing, as witnessed in my response here.<i> Insecure Majorities</i> is a landmark study that will provoke scholarly debate for years to come." (<i>Congress &amp; the Presidency</i>)<br><br>"Frances Lee has published another tour de force. Building upon her argument in <i>Beyond Ideology</i> (2009) (and the other literature from the last few years surrounding it), she adds an important wrinkle into the current divide between the parties in Congress. . . . Lee marshals compelling evidence at the macro level to show how insecure majorities make governing exceedingly difficult."&nbsp; (<i>Perspectives on Politics</i>)</p><h2>Toyota Rav4 1996-2002 (Haynes Repair Manuals)</h2><p>Inside this manual you will find routine maintenance, tune-up procedures, engine repair, cooling and heating, air conditioning, fuel and exhaust, emissions control, ignition, brakes, suspension and steering, electrical systems, and wiring diagrams.</p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>A whirlwind tour of the sexual revolution in America, <i>Make Love, Not War</i> grew from the author's fascination with a bygone period of rebellion and experimentation whose effects linger throughout the culture. Born in 1969, David Allyn remembers "growing up with the vague sense of having missed something magical and mysterious. I remember the adolescent's agony of realizing that my parents and teachers had witnessed extraordinary social transformations, the likes of which we might never see again." Allyn's zest for his subject, and his dewy-eyed admiration of the sexual pioneers of the '60s and '70s, make him a pleasure to read, although the topic may be too large for a book of this size. There is little space to put subjects like public nudity, the demise of censorship, and the challenge to miscegenation laws into historical context. The author's more detailed discussions fare better, and he offers engaging new source material--in many cases from his own interviews--on open marriage, the joys of the Pill, gay liberation, and the sexual double standard. Although an advocate for sexual freedom, Allyn notes the paradox that "perhaps, in the end, shining the light of liberation into every dark corner of daily life has made it more difficult to indulge in some sexual pleasures spontaneously and unself-consciously." We may now feel an urge to define ourselves sexually at a young age, he argues, missing out on the thrill of the forbidden, and the chance to just fool around. <i>--Regina Marler</i>David Allyn has a Ph.D. from Harvard and has taught history at Princeton.

This is an essential book for anyone with a loved one on the job--anyone who needs to understand the inherent strains, quirks, and challenges of police work. Dr. Kirschman writes with skill, wisdom, and grace, honoring police officers while still holding them accountable. <i>I Love a Cop</i> is a gift."--Sgt. Adam Plantinga, San Francisco Police Department, 16-year police veteran and author of <i>400 Things Cops Know</i><br><br> "This book contributed to incredible changes in my life and marriage by teaching me that I was not alone in times of pain. The law enforcement culture has an unspoken code that all matters stay 'in house,' but cops are people first, and sometimes we all need help. Dr. Kirschman really gets the issues we face as a family of blue."--Karen F., Chico, California<br><br> "Dr. Kirschman does a terrific job of addressing difficult issues that those in the cop world usually don't talk about. The book brings into perspective the difficulties and risks of the job and the impact on our families and ourselves, as well as ways to keep the family and self whole.

I loved reading about others with similar experiences. Dr. Kirschman has helped me understand how the job affects my spouse, how I can take care of myself during times of chaos, and ways we can communicate better and strengthen our relationship."--Karin B., Vacaville, California<br><br> "During my tenure as Chief of Police, I gave a copy of this book to each new officer I swore into my department. I explained that the Police Academy teaches the 'how-tos' of the job--and Dr. Kirschman teaches how to manage the impact on our lives. The ever-changing demands placed on law enforcement personnel today are all covered insightfully in this remarkable third edition."--Lucy Carlton, retired Chief of Police, Los Altos Police Department, California<br><br> "I have been recommending this incredibly compassionate and wholly realistic book since it first came out. Policing has changed in the past two decades, but Dr. Kirschman&#x2019;s passion for this profession has not. The third edition includes new coverage of substantive issues such as social media use, bad press, racial tensions, and more. I teach thousands of police officers each year in topics ranging from officer safety to gender dynamics, and <i>I Love a Cop</i> is one of the two books that I insist every police officer must purchase, read, and share."--Sgt.

Annie Proulx's first novel, <i>Postcards,</i> winner of the 1993 Pen/Faulkner Award for Fiction, tells the mesmerizing tale of Loyal Blood, who misspends a lifetime running from a crime so terrible that it renders him forever incapable of touching a woman. <br> Blood's odyssey begins in 1944 and takes him across the country from his hardscrabble Vermont hill farm to New York, across Ohio, Minnesota, and Montana to British Columbia, on to North Dakota, Wyoming, and New Mexico and ends, today, in California, with Blood homeless and near mad. Along the way, he must live a hundred lives to survive, mining gold, growing beans, hunting fossils and trapping, prospecting for uranium, and ranching. In his absence, disaster befalls his family; greatest among their terrible losses are the hard-won values of endurance and pride that were the legacy of farm people rooted in generations of intimacy with soil, weather, plants, and seasons. <br> <i>Postcards</i> chronicles the lives of the rural and the dispossessed and charts their territory with the historical verisimilitude and writerly prowess of Cather, Dreiser, and Faulkner. It is a new American classic.</p><p>Reproduced as graphics that preface narrative sections, the postcards in this novel -- communications between the Blood family and their son Loyal, as well as other personal mail and advertising material -- progressively reveal the insecurity of the rural Bloods in the changing post-war world. Loyal has fled into exile after an accidental killing, but cannot find a haven of rest. The family patriarch, Mink, writes vitriolic letters to local agricultural agents when the real object of his ire is his absent son. Loyal&#39;s brother sends off for an artificial arm to replace the one he lost in an accident; his sister answers a mail order ad for a husband. Through the mail, Proulx inventively reveals the inchoate longings of a difficult existence in this winner of the 1993 PEN/Faulkner Award.Annie Proulx is the author of eight books, including the novel <i>The Shipping News</i> and the story collection <i>Close Range</i>.

In France it is considered one of the most important works of art history to have appeared in the last twenty years. With the exception of Michel Foucault's analysis of Las Meninas, it is perhaps the first time a structuralist method such as the one developed by Claude Levi-Strauss in The Way of the Masks has been thoroughly and convincingly applied to Western art.<br>The task Damisch has set for himself is to refute both the positivist critics, whose approach makes up the bulk of perspective studies and is based on a complete repression of Panofsky's early work, and the current pseudo-avant-gardist position (whether in the field of cinema studies or in literary criticism), which tends to disregard facts and theoretical analysis. Damisch argues that if a theoretical analysis of perspective is possible, using all the tools of structuralist semiotics, it is only possible in the context of a close look at its appearance in history, beginning with the details of the "invention" of perspective.<br>In the first part Damisch reassesses Panofsky's account, considered here as the theoretical starting block. While he appreciates the extraordinary depth of Panofsky's text, Damisch exposes its shortcomings, and prepares to show through various examples that perspective in painting is not simply a matter of verisimilitude, but of thought, the notion of "thought in painting" being at the core of his work.<br>The second part of the book brings the historical invention of perspective into focus, discussing the experiments with mirrors made by Brunelleschi, connecting it to the history of consciousness via Jacques Lacan's definition of the "tableau" as "a configuration in which the subject as such gets its bearings."<br>In the third - and most pointedly structuralist - part, Damisch traces the history of the "perspective paradigm," with a full discussion of the theoretical implications of its constitutive moments, in a brilliant analysis of the three known panel paintings of the "ideal City" produced in the quattrocento, in Piero della Francesca's works, in Carpaccio's works, and finally in Velasquez's Las Meninas.</p><p>Hubert Damisch is on the faculty of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris.Text: English<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Clinical Nursing Skills: Basic to Advanced Skills</h2><p><i>Clinical Nursing Skills 7e </i>remains a best-selling, comprehensive source of the essential information needed for success at all levels of nursing. With more than 1200 full-color images illustrating over 750 new and updated skills, this book is&nbsp; an invaluable tool that no nursing student or practicing nurse should be without. Exciting new features included in the 7th edition are: evidenced based nursing care; cultural/religious considerations; case studies; expanded management guidelines; and a focus on community based nursing.</p><p><p> </p><p> The sixth edition of Clinical Nursing Skills continues its high standards for skill presentation. This new edition is expanded to include new chapters as well as new sections of material relevant for the twenty-first-century nurse. </p> <p> The authors have strived to make this edition current, complete, and relevant for all nursing students, from those who are learning basic skills to senior students who are mastering critical care skills. The majority of skills in this text are also appropriate for the working clinical nurse. Because this text is so comprehensive, it has been adopted by many hospitals as their procedure manual. </p> <p> Clinical Nursing Skills is a performance-based text written for all levels of nursing education: baccalaureate, associate degree, and diploma. New skills, new photos and illustrations, and new introductory material have been added throughout the text. Also, the text has expanded its very popular Critical Thinking Application at the end of each unit and added Critical Thinking Strategies, with scenarios based on chapter material to stimulate critical thinking ability. </p> <p> Faculty feedback from prior editions confirms that the most effective way to utilize this text is to teach from the most basic to the more complex skills. The student will learn and perform each specific skill, while also learning how to assess the client, formulate nursing diagnoses, perform the procedure, evaluate the results, and document the pertinent data. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK</b></p> <p> The Nursing Process continues to provide the organizing framework for this textbook. Within each of the 34 chapters, skills are grouped by unit. Nursing process data is then provided for each skill group or unit. Each procedure includes a list of equipment necessary to perform the skill, preparation, and step-by-step nursing interventions. Many steps include rationale for the nursing action. In order not to be redundant or repeat rationale time after time, we have limited these inserts to those most relevant. </p> <p> The clear and concise format enables the student to easily access key material for immediate reference in the clinical area. Extensive color photographs and drawings within each unit illustrate the concepts presented and enable the student to visualize each step that must be performed. </p> <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p> <ul> <li><b>More than 650 skills,</b> new and updated, are included in this new edition, including basic, intermediate, and advanced skills. Presented in the Nursing Process framework, this text has <b>more than 1,100 pieces of art</b> to illustrate the skills.</li> <li>A new, extensive chapter entitled <b>"Bioterrorism&#x2014;Disaster Nursing"</b> has been added to this edition. The impetus for including this material was a report by the American Hospital Association (AHA) entitled <i>Hospital Preparedness for Mass Casualties.</i> This report emphasized that a major barrier to developing and implementing a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) response training program is that most schools of nursing do not include this content in their basic curricula and do not prepare the graduating nurse to become a high-level participant in a WMD response team. The authors have included this chapter to assist schools of nursing to quickly add this important content to their curricula, with the hope that in the future, nurses will be prepared (with knowledge and skills) to participate on a professional level with a response team.</li> <li><b>Two new sections, maternity and pediatrics,</b> have been added to the physical assessment chapter, which makes this chapter an all-inclusive reference. Selected pediatric and maternity skills have also been added.</li> <li><b>Critical thinking</b> is found in two places throughout this edition. <b>Critical Thinking Strategies</b> in the form of case studies have been added at the end of each chapter to assist students to practice application of critical thinking principles to clinical situations. <b>Critical Thinking Application</b> sections, which include <b>unexpected outcomes and critical thinking options</b> are placed at the end of each unit. This section assists the student to apply the process of critical thinking when unexpected outcomes occur.</li> <li><b>Cultural Competence and Evidence Based Nursing Practice</b> are adjunct data that have been added to this edition: <i>cultural competence</i> reminds students that cultural diversity principles play a major role in providing client care; and <i>evidence based nursing practice</i> demonstrates how to build a research base for specific interventions in client care.</li> <li><b>Photos of newly introduced equipment</b> are included to denote advances in medical technology.</li> <li><b>Management Guidelines</b> complete each chapter. This component includes <b>Delegation of Responsibilities</b> to teach the student nurse to make critical judgments when delegating tasks within the framework of legal, safe, and appropriate boundaries. It also includes a section on <b>Information Flow,</b> which assists the student to assume a management role by learning to prioritize and communicate relevant client data to members of the health care team.</li> </ul> <p><b>HALLMARK FEATURES</b></p> <p> Because each chapter "stands alone" and is consistently and independently structured, <i>Clinical Nursing Skills</i> can be adapted to all fundamental texts or any program curriculum. This feature allows faculty to use any conceptual model (Newman, Roy, Orem, Rogers, etc.) in the curriculum and to teach the material in any sequence. <i>Clinical Nursing Skills</i> remains the most complete and adaptable nursing skills text available. </p> <ul> <li>More than 1,100 full-color photographs, line drawings, charts, and tables depict step-by-step nursing procedures. These clear, specific, and up-to-date illustrations display new equipment and new procedures, as well as nurses performing basic to advanced skills.</li> <li>Each chapter's introductory material provides the basic theoretical foundation for the procedures that follow. Pedagogic features include <b>Learning Objectives</b> and <b>Terminology</b> pertinent to that chapter. <b>Nursing Diagnoses</b> (phrased in the latest terminology) are relevant to the chapter content and precede step-by-step procedures.</li> <li>Additional learning aids in each chapter will help the student assimilate the immense amount of nursing content. For example, <b>Rationale</b> for specific nursing actions assists the student to understand why certain actions are performed. Rationale is selective and pertinent to prevent overloading the student with too much data, which may occur if rationale is presented for every major step in each skill.</li> <li><b>Clinical Alerts</b> throughout the skills call attention to safety issues, essential information, and actions that require critical decision making. Focus material in boxes and shaded areas emphasizes aspects of client care relevant to the skills.</li> <li>Frequent <b>Charts and Tables</b> supplement the procedures with useful information.</li> <li>For those schools using NIC and NOC, please note that <b>Expected Outcomes</b> continue to be found (and have been included in this book since the first, 1982, edition) in the Evaluation section of Nursing Process Data for each Unit. <b>Unexpected Outcomes</b> are presented in the <b>Critical Thinking Application</b> for each Unit.</li> <li>Two valuable sections are at the end of each chapter: <b>Gerontologic Considerations</b> present specific concepts that influence or affect care of the elderly; and Management Guidelines, as described above.</li> </ul> <p><b>NCLEX RESOURCE</b></p> <p> This text will effectively assist students to pass NCLEX. The national licensure examination for nurses (NCLEX) primarily focuses on decision-making and judgment in the clinical area. <i>The Practice Analysis of Newly Licensed Registered Nurses,</i> published by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, lists 189 nursing activities performed by newly licensed nurses throughout the United States. These activities, many of which are nursing skills, comprise the framework for developing the NCLEX question pool. <i>Clinical Nursing Skills</i> includes all of these skills and 75% of the overall activities listed in the Job Analysis. </p> <p><b>SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS</b></p> <p> For faculty who adopt <i>Clinical Nursing Skills,</i> a valuable Instructor's Manual is available. Each chapter of the manual includes: </p> <ul> <li>Teaching/learning strategies</li> <li>Listings of reference and resource materials</li> <li>Critical thinking scenarios (originating in the text) and exercises with resolution suggestions</li> <li>Content exam questions with answers for a content review</li> <li>Checklists for all skills in printed form</li> <li>A CD-ROM, packaged with every textbook, contains checklists for all skills</li> </ul> <p><b>WHAT DISTINGUISHES <i>CLINICAL NURSING SKILLS</i></b></p> <p> Its all-inclusive, clear, and concise format that teaches the student to: </p> <ul> <li>Learn each skill from basic to advanced in a contextual framework.</li> <li>Understand the theoretical concepts that serve as a foundation for skills.</li> <li>Apply this knowledge to a clinical situation with a "client need" focus.</li> <li>Use critical thinking to evaluate the outcome of the skill and consider unexpected outcomes.</li> <li>Appreciate cultural diversity principles as they apply to client situations.</li> <li>Validate clinical skills by applying evidence based nursing practice data and studies.</li> <li>Function in, and adapt to, the professional role by understanding management responsibilities.</li> </ul> <p> Our primary goal in writing <i>Clinical Nursing Skills,</i> 6th edition, is to produce a relevant, useful, and comprehensive text that is adaptable to various programs and learning needs of students. Further, the authors hope that faculty will find this textbook a valuable teaching tool and reference for clinical practice. </p></p><h2>Other Worlds: Space, Superspace, and the Quantum Universe</h2><p>Paul Davies explains the significance of the amazing quantum universe, where fact is stranger than any science fiction.

It includes recent Supreme Court cases, a completely revised chapter on international securities enforcement, and updated coverage of SEC enforcement actions, as well as state securities law, international issues, and the regulation of investment companies.</p><p></p><h2>Against Humanity: Lessons from the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Gunya is a woman in her late twenties. Soldiers of the Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army (LRA) abducted her when she was eleven years old and forcefully conscripted her into the rebel ranks. Gunya spent a little over a decade with the rebels before deserting. While there, she gave birth to a son with Onen, an LRA soldier. Though abducted, she expresses her continued support for the LRA and their tactics, admitting that she sometimes thinks of going back to the lum [bush] when life becomes hard as a civilian at home.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> This is not a book about crimes against humanity.&nbsp;Rather, it is an indictment of the very idea of humanity, the concept that lies at the heart of human rights and humanitarian missions.&nbsp;<br><br> Based on fieldwork in northern Uganda, anthropologist and medical doctor Sam Dubal brings readers into the inner circle of the Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army, an insurgent group accused of rape, forced conscription of children, and inhumane acts of violence. Dubal speaks with former LRA rebels as they find personal meaning in wartime violence, politics, and spirituality&#x2014;experiences that observers often place outside of humanity&#x2019;s boundaries.&nbsp;What emerges is an unorthodox and provocative question: What would it mean to be truly against humanity? And how does one honor life existing outside hegemonic notions of the good?</p><p>&#x201c;A courageous call for a revolutionary medicine to upset and upend the western, enlightened, global interventions by humanitarian doctors who are collaborators with the state and fueled by international donors and ecumenic interests to crush a guerrilla insurrection in the jungles of Uganda. Sam Dubal&#x2019;s <i>Against Humanity</i> is an intimate portrait of the political passions, logical mysticism, crazy hubris, and humor of Joseph Kony&#x2019;s soldiers, who were demonized by the West. This turning of the tables is ethnographic anthropology at its best: the difficult science that afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted. The dangers of humanity and its pomps and its perils are made painfully clear."&#x2014;Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Professor of Medical Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley<br><br> "A bold book, and a brave one. Swimming against the intellectual currents of our time, Dubal uses his ethnographic encounter with the Lord's Resistance Army to ask searching questions about the damage done by discourses of humanity and forms of moral reasoning that that render some people&#x2019;s violence (and not others&#x2019;) inhuman. His far-reaching argument challenges all those who would do good (in Africa or elsewhere) to think beyond humanist ethics by engaging with a wider set of social and political contexts and commitments."&#x2014; James Ferguson, Professor and Chair of Anthropology, Stanford University<br><br> "This book is a challenging, committed, and open work that puts forth a comprehensive case for abandoning some of our most basic moral and intellectual articles of faith. It represents a novel intervention into the literature of political violence and its aftermath in Africa, and more broadly into anthropological debates around fundamental questions of ontology, politics, and ethics."&#x2014;Adam Branch, Director, Centre of African Studies, University of Cambridge<b>Sam Dubal&nbsp;</b>is a medical anthropologist and a surgical resident at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.</p><h2>Wee Sing Nursery Rhymes and Lullabies</h2><p>The bestselling Wee Sing line is now tailored for the most modern Wee Sing fans!

The significant factor in this maritime traffic was cargo--supplies for miners and an expanding population. Delgado, maritime historian of the National Park Service, here presents a comprehensive account of shipping during the gold rush era. He reviews briefly maritime trade prior to 1848--furs, hides, whaling--and the settling of San Francisco. He follows shipping around the Horn, steamship service on the Panama and Nicaragua routes and California traffic. Panama steamers carried homebound argonauts and mail until that service was taken over by the U.S. Navy in 1850. Delgado explores the development of the San Francisco waterfront and maritime industries along the coast; he describes shipwrecks and efforts to salvage cargo. This colorful history is a notable addition to the literature of the gold rush. Illustrated. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This maritime history of the California Gold Rush narrows the focus to sea-faring gold seekers as they sailed to the state. From the establishment of early ports and the need for seafaring laws to the evolution of towns and regulatory agencies, this provides a different perspective on the Gold Rush's affect on maritime industry. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>History of the World in Maps: The Rise and Fall of Empires, Countries and Cities</h2><p>From Babylonian tablets to Google Maps, the world has evolved rapidly, along with the ways in which we see it.

His beloved satirical classic, <i>Keep the Aspidistra Flying, </i>features a young idealist whose attempt to rebel against middle-class respectability&#x2014;by working in a bookshop and trying to be a writer&#x2014;goes terribly and comically awry. The hero of <i>Coming Up for Air</i> tries to escape the bleakness of suburbia by returning to the idyllic rural village of his childhood&#x2014;only to find that the simpler England he remembers so nostalgically is gone forever.<br><br>These three novels share Orwell&#x2019;s unsparing vision of the dark side of modern capitalist society in combination with his comic brilliance and his unerring compassion for humanity.</p><p>Imagine crossing E.M. Forster with Jane Austen. Stir in a bit of socialist doctrine, a sprig of satire, strong Indian curry, and a couple quarts of good English gin and you get something close to the flavor of George Orwell's intensely readable and deftly plotted <i>Burmese Days</i>. In 1930, Kyauktada, Upper Burma, is one of the least auspicious postings in the ailing British Empire--and then the order comes that the European Club, previously for whites only, must elect one token native member. This edict brings out the worst in this woefully enclosed society, not to mention among the natives who would become the One. Orwell mines his own Anglo-Indian background to evoke both the suffocating heat and the stifling pettiness that are the central facts of colonial life: "Mr. MacGregor told his anecdote about Prome, which could be produced in almost any context. And then the conversation veered back to the old, never-palling subject--the insolence of the natives, the supineness of the Government, the dear dead days when the British Raj <i>was</i> the Raj and please give the bearer fifteen lashes. The topic was never let alone for long, partly because of Ellis's obsession. Besides, you could forgive the Europeans a great deal of their bitterness. Living and working among Orientals would try the temper of a saint."<p> Protagonist James Flory is a timber merchant, whose facial birthmark serves as an outward expression of the ironic and left-leaning habits of mind that make him inwardly different from his coevals. Flory appreciates the local culture, has native allegiances, and detests the racist machinations of his fellow Club members. Alas, he doesn't always possess the moral courage, or the energy, to stand against them. His almost embarrassingly Anglophile friend, Dr. Veraswami, the highest-ranking native official, seems a shoo-in for Club membership, until Machiavellian magistrate U Po Kyin launches a campaign to discredit him that results, ultimately, in the loss not just of reputations but of lives. Whether to endorse Veraswami or to betray him becomes a kind of litmus test of Flory's character.</p><p> Against this backdrop of politics and ethics, Orwell throws the shadow of romance. The arrival of the bobbed blonde, marriageable, and resolutely anti-intellectual Elizabeth Lackersteen not only casts Flory as hapless suitor but gives Orwell the chance to show that he's as astute a reporter of nuanced social interactions as he is of political intrigues. In fact, his combination of an astringently populist sensibility, dead-on observations of human behavior, formidable conjuring skills, and no-frills prose make for historical fiction that stands triumphantly outside of time. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>In this caustic, fast-paced novel about the waning days of British imperialism, George Orwell draws on his years of experience in India, the country of his birth. The story focuses on a handful of Englishmen living in a small settlement in Upper Burma. They congregate in the European Club, drinking whiskey and arguing over an impending order to admit a token Asian.</p><h2>UNIX text processing (Hayden Books UNIX library system)</h2><p>Book by O&#39;Reilly, Tim, Dougherty, D.</p><p></p><h2>Why Early A.A.

This profusely illustrated survey is the first to incorporate modern scholarship and examine the Baroque and Rococo eras contextually. Vernon Hyde Minor explores the styles, institutions, cities, and genres that shaped this period's great artistic outpouring-and illuminates the achievements of Bernini, Caravaggio, Fragonard, Rembrandt, Rubens, Velzquez, Vermeer, Watteau, and other notable artists. With unusually thorough coverage of women artists, town planning, and domestic interiors and gardening, Baroque &amp; Rococo brilliantly captures the swirling cultural currents of the time from Counter Reformation Rome to Louis XIV's Versailles to bourgeois Amsterdam. 359 illustrations, 150 in full color, 8 x 10" Vernon Hyde Minor is chair of the department of fine arts at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the author of Abrams' Art History's History.<p><b>PREFACE</b></p> <p> Baroque and Rococo. For some years I have been struck by how literary and art historians have been beating a retreat from both these terms, as if they were redolent of an unseemly preoccupation with styles, and highly suspect styles at that. Many scholars feel more comfortable with phrases such as "Early Modern," whose meaning may be no clearer but whose overtones seem more neutral. </p> <p> So what is so pernicious about "Baroque" and "Rococo," and why has an entire generation passed since the last appearance of a general textbook on the art of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? First, because Baroque and Rococo were styles of courtly societies (whether religious or secular) the public of the new millennium, with its fairly consensual beliefs in a pluralist and meritocratic culture, may feel uncomfortable with the bombast and immodesty of these self-aggrandizing civilizations. Inevitably, we are reminded of the arrogant authoritarianism endemic in such centralized, statist governments. We recall all too quickly that the words "Baroque" and "Rococo" are highly implicated in displays of imperial power. Another problem is that we tend to reify the terms, to talk about the Baroque, for instance, as if it were a thing. When one writes of a "Baroque mind" or a "Baroque sensibility" one is using a permissible intellectual shorthand; but we need to remind ourselves that Baroque and Rococo were (and are) terms invented by historians and that they function as handy labels; they should not be seen as somehow living, breathing, historical entities that cross the centuries like phantoms. Perhaps it is feared that such vivid terms as Baroque and Rococo can summon to life a slumbering <i>Zeitgeist</i> and set back historical criticism a century or more. </p> <p> On a basic level, I would argue that there is enough artistic cohesion and distinctiveness to the period to justify devoting a book to it. But more deeply, my intention in <i>Baroque &amp; Rococo: Art &amp; Culture</i> has been to brave the currents of the potentially unfashionable and anachronistic while addressing legitimate concerns about the ways in which we art historians have gone about our business. I believe that we should not flinch from artistic manifestations of power (be they of courtly or capitalist societies), but should look upon, analyze, and&#x2014;another dangerous verb!&#x2014;appreciate them. </p> <p> Contextualization is one important facet of the so-called "new art history." For more than a century, major Western museums have been displaying works as artistic strays, images and objects pulled from their original locations and placed on pedestals or mounted on walls. To a certain extent, the same holds true of architecture: photography has allowed us to study buildings as if they were framed, isolated <i>objets d'art.</i> To "recontextualize" art means to attempt to see works as they were seen (and where they were seen) by representative viewers at the time of their production. It is foolish to imagine that we can somehow shed our modern identities and re-enter the seventeenth century as typical citizens, worshippers, businessmen, prelates, lords and ladies, intellectuals, workers, and so on; yet the attempt is interesting and worthwhile. We study the past to increase our awareness and consciousness of what it has meant and what it does mean to be human and to be alive. By contextualizing art we can have a rich understanding of the human interest in the use of images to express emotions and ideas, assert authority and presence, concretize beliefs and summon supernatural aid, increase awareness of self and other, reflect, refract, and project one's own identity through the present and into the future. </p> <p> To my mind, the best general text on the Baroque has been John Rupert Martin's <i>Baroque</i> (Harper and Row, 1977). Martin did not erect a historical structure and then prevail upon it to produce his examples; rather, he allowed certain circumstances and ideas to surface. He wrote essays on style, naturalism, passions of the soul, space, time, light, and soon. The result was a singular view of the Baroque, one that is at the same time personal and grounded in history. Donald Posner and Julius Held, two important scholars in Baroque and Rococo studies, produced the widely used textbook, <i>Seventeenth and Eighteenth-century Art</i> (Prentice-Hall/Abrams, 1971). They followed the standard practice in traditional art history of dividing the material along geographical and chronological lines. One can read, for instance, chapters on France in the seventeenth century, or Germany and Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or Dutch painting in the seventeenth century. This kind of book has the virtue of providing straightforward forms of organization. But it over looks the obvious cosmopolitanism of the period and fails to take into account the ways in which the academies themselves divided up the visual arts. The traditional survey text accepts the nineteenth-century notion that one can best understand art along two basic axes: as it develops ("perfects itself") through time and as it is an expression of "national character." </p> <p> I have departed from earlier models in several important ways. The present text abandons the simpler forms of chronological and geographical organization (although these are mostly retained within individual chapters) in order to cut into the substance of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century art along different grains and for the purpose of revealing different patterns. The main form of organization is both thematic and idea-oriented. One important theme, or site, is the church. I have described representative examples from the outside in, concentrating on the basic structure and its symbolic significance. Then a survey of the church interior follows, with considerations of altarpieces, ceiling paintings, and funerary monuments. One confronts the central ideological imagery of Catholicism in altarpieces, experiences the mind's road to God on ceilings, and contemplates the church's magisterium in tombs. In addition, I have borrowed a page from the academies of art by concentrating on categories of art, such as portraits and still lifes, landscapes, genres, and views. After these comes a separate chapter on town and country, which enables readers to compare urban planning in Amsterdam and Rome and examine the construction of grand country estates, such as Versailles. Then one turns to different kinds of environments, such as domestic interior spaces (sometimes as mediated through paintings) and gardens. </p> <p> Several of the over-arching themes of this text have to do with theory. Chapter 1 introduces the terms "Baroque" and "Rococo" as they have been employed by critics, scholars, and teachers of art and art history. Chapter 5 returns the discussion to elements of rhetoric, the deployment of styles in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for the purposes of persuasion and pleasure. Then in Chapter 10, the epilogue, I revisit some of the theories actually discussed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. </p> <p> The movement of the text is centripetal rather than forward and linear. Instead of beginning at the beginning and working toward the end, <i>Baroque and Rococo</i> circles the art of two centuries, continually pushing the discussion back toward the center. Nevertheless, we have striven to show consideration to those concerned about chronology. As mentioned before, <i>within</i> most chapters the progression is from early Baroque to late Rococo. And Chapter 2 is an important scene-setter, providing country-by-country background information on the politics, wars, religious upheavals and artistic milieux of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Finally, on page 371 readers will find a ten-page illustrated timeline, which places the great artworks of the epoch in the context of broader social, cultural, and political events. </p> <p> Every teacher of art history has his or her own way of organizing the material. No single approach, or textbook, is "right," because there is no <i>single</i> ideal sequence of artists and topics. It is my hope that this text will nonetheless serve the needs of students and teachers alike, that however the art of the Baroque and Rococo is presented in class, reading this text will provide important information and perspectives on a core set of issues and works of art. Above all, it has been my intention to keep works of art at the heart of the book, not to use them as punctuation marks within a narrative of cultural history. I have tried to provide readings of buildings, statues, and paintings that demonstrate the complexity of visual ideas and that respect an art that we see imperfectly (if not darkly) through the glass of the present. </p> <p> <i>Boulder, Colorado<br> May 1999</i> </p></p><h2>FrenchSmart Grade 5 - Learning Workbook For Fifth Grade Students &#x2013; French Language Educational Workbook for Vocabulary, Reading and Grammar!

The word comes from the Greek <i>philanthropus</i>&#x2014;"love of humankind"&#x2014;which actually makes no mention of money. Anyone with generosity of mind and spirit can take action and be a philanthropist. <br><br> <b>What is <i>Giving 2.0? </i></b><br> <i>Giving 2.0</i> introduces everyone to new ways of thinking about giving. Rather than passively reacting and writing checks, it means embracing a state of constant learning, improvement, and innovation. Too often, we fail to support our giving with planning or research into the issues, organizations, or strategies that have the greatest impact. This means we unintentionally waste resources and miss learning opportunities, ultimately at the expense of those we&#x2019;re trying to help. <br><br> With today's problems that demand increasingly complex solutions and philanthropic resources that are tightly stretched, we need to do more with less. We need to harness our minds as well as our hearts to innovate, learn, pool resources, collaborate, and rigorously measure our philanthropic actions. Only then will we bring about significant change in our world. <br><br> <b>Who is this book for? </b><br> <i>Giving 2.0</i> is for everyone&#x2014;regardless of age, income, profession, religion, or background&#x2014; who wants to help transform our world. As a resource, it will educate and inspire those who want to start giving. And for those already giving&#x2014;whether they are donating a few hundred dollars a year or a few hundred thousand, or volunteering time or expertise&#x2014;this book will help anyone take his or her giving from reactive to proactive and momentarily gratifying to consistently meaningful. <br><br> <b>How did you start your own giving journey? </b> <br> My giving journey has been guided by the actions, service, and values of my parents. My late mother, Frances Arrillaga, and my father, John Arrillaga Sr., are my philanthropic heroes&#x2014;they inspired me to devote my life to philanthropy. <br><br> After losing my mother to cancer, I looked for an organization that would educate and empower me to be an effective philanthropist. I longed for a community of givers with whom to share ideas and compare stories. When I could not find one, I created SV2 (Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund), a giving circle that brings together philanthropists to learn how to give more effectively. It pools funds while helping members develop knowledge about issues, collaborate on grantmaking, and use their expertise and networks to help innovative early-stage nonprofits to expand. <br><br> I have also taught "Strategic Philanthropy" at Stanford Graduate School of Business since 2000 and founded Stanford PACS (Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society). I&#x2019;ve worked to help philanthropists navigate the complexities of giving by designing organizations, networks, and resources to educate and inspire anyone who wants to give more effectively. <i>Giving 2.0</i> is an important part of those efforts, all of which stem from the same powerful message&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t need to donate huge dollars to make a huge impact. <br><br><p>"<i>Giving 2.0</i> is a real gift to anybody committed to using his or her life, resources, and energies to make the world a better place. I've been involved in philanthropy, nonprofit organizations, and fundraising for over 20 years, and this is without a doubt the most comprehensive and accessible guide to smart philanthropy that I have ever encountered.

And in times of joy and celebration families with strong spiritual lives rejoice in deeper and more wondrous ways. But what exactly is it that characterizes faith and spirituality in family life? Identifying resilience, strength, and faith in the stories of all kinds of families, <i>Sacred Stories of Ordinary Families</i> motivates readers to think about how faith shapes their own family lives. Drawn from Diana R. Garland's extensive interviews with 110 families, this book includes stories from ordinary families whose lives together both reveal and rely on extraordinary faith.</p><p><p><b>DIANA R. GARLAND</b> is the chair of the School of Social Work Department at Baylor University and director of Baylor's Center for Family and Community Ministries. Her previous works include Family Ministry: A Comprehensive Guide.</p>Garland, chair for the School of Social Work Department at Baylor University, poses an interesting bevy of questions as she explores the relationship between faith and family. In the course of her research to seek and locate the broadest range of participants, Garland interviewed over 110 families individually and conducted 32 congregational surveys from four regions in the United States. Garland purposefully selected contributors from the Southern Baptist, National Baptist, United Methodist, and Presbyterian denominations in her quest to discover how families interact with one another in times of celebration as well as through stretches of hardship and trial. Garland's interviewees were presented with thoughtful, reflective questions to gauge how faith informs family dynamics: How does the family live out its faith? When was God perceived as close? What Bible story best reflects the family's own experience? Given that Garland revisits each family's stories chapter by chapter, this text might have developed into a reader's nightmare in an attempt to follow each family's journey, yet Garland does an excellent job meshing new topics with ongoing conversations. Interested readers will find her gentle probing both fascinating and insightful as she draws the deeper life lessons from those she interviewed. However, religion professionals, clergy and educators will likely appreciate her findings more than the typical lay reader. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>National Geographic Readers: Creepy Crawly Collection</h2><p>Frogs, snakes, ants, and bats!

The original edition of Child Art Therapy was a significant contribution to the literature of this field describing a broad range of educational and clinical settings within which to develop an understanding of a child s ideas and needs, as well as helping the child gain awareness, acceptance, liking, and control of his or her own feeling-self. This revised edition provides updated information on progress in child art therapy and explores the author s recent experiences in the field, including work with deaf children and multimodal therapy involving the closely related activities of art therapy and play therapy. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of this edition is the inclusion of photographs of children s original art throughout the book: these works, better than any representation, eloquently communicate the often paradoxical combination of simplicity and nuance that typifies the thoughts and feelings of children. An essential tool for art therapists and art teachers, Child Art Therapy will also be a valuable aid for anyone who strives to nurture the creative processes in children and to help children fully realize their potential.Judith A. Rubin received a B.A. in art from Wellesley College, an M.Ed. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and a Ph.D. in counseling from the University of Pittsburgh. She later was graduated from the training programs in adult and child psychoanalysis at the Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic Institute. A registered art therapist and a licensed psychologist, Dr. Rubin is currently Co-Director of the Creative and Expressive Arts Therapy Program at the Western Psychiatric Institute &amp; Clinic. She is also Assistant Professor of Child Psychiatry and Health-Related Professions at the University of Pittsburgh, a member of the Faculty-by-Invitation of the Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic Institute, and a former president and honorary life member of the American Art Therapy Association.</p><h2>The Princess Casamassima</h2><p>Mark Twain once famously said "there was but one solitary thing about the past worth remembering, and that was the fact that it is past and can't be restored."&nbsp; Well, over recent years, The British Library, working with Microsoft has embarked on an ambitious programme to digitise its collection of 19th century books.<p>There are now 65,000&nbsp; titles available&nbsp; (that's an incredible 25 million pages) of material ranging from works by famous names such as&nbsp; Dickens, Trollope and Hardy as well as many forgotten literary gems , all of which can now be printed on demand and purchased right here on Amazon.</p><p>Further information on The British Library and its digitisation programme can be found on The British Library website.</p></p><p>Brought up in poverty, Hyacinth has nevertheless developed aesthetic tastes that heighten his awareness of the sordid misery around him. He is drawn into the secret world of revolutionary politics and, in a moment of fervour, makes a vow that he will assassinate a major political figure. Soon after this he meets the beautiful Princess Casamassima. Captivated by her world of wealth and nobility, art and beauty, Hyacinth loses faith in radicalism, &#39;the beastly cause.&#39; But tormented by his belief in honour, he must face an agonizing, and ultimately tragic, dilemma.When Henry James chose to, as he did in The Princess Casamassima, he could write about the political turbulence of his era with astonishing excitement and directness. The London underworld of terrorist conspiracies that entangles his hero, Hyacinth Robinson, comes alive under his pen with a violence that seems, 100 years later, only too familiar.</p><h2>Fluid Mechanics</h2><p>Provides a comprehensive treatment of the essentials of the subject for students of civil, mechanical or chemical engineering and building services or environmental engineering.

In this book lies critical knowledge that is key to the continued existence of human beings on this planet.</p>Voyagers is a set of books best approached by asking the question: What do we really know about the nature of reality? Many of the ideas presented in this book are different from the old belief paradigms through which we have been taught to view reality, they do not negate the old, but rather challenge old ideas to evolve. I suggest that the reader take an open-minded approach to the information contained in this book, in order to receive the benefits of the Voyagers material. The greatest benefit of the Voyagers perspective is the gift of an uncommon knowledge, through which some of the mysterious aspects of reality can be comprehended and the majesty of personal existence may be rediscovered. <p>Challenges inspire growth and Voyagers is a challenge, it is a book to grow with in your quest for understanding. Voyagers is not the average book, its implications are so intrinsically profound that at times it seems unbelievable, but this is not a fiction story. It is not just a book of ideas. It is evidence of a most intimate journey through personal events that can be described as nothing less than extraordinary. This book is not about my personal experiences, it is rather the result of those experiences. If the book is approached with flexibility of mind and a keen intuition, its message can be enlightening, its implications transformational. </p><p>Confronted with extraordinary experiences, I found that the integrity of my being was on the line and I was not about to write myself off as mentally deranged until I had fully examined other possible explanations for the events I had encountered. This confrontation finally led me to question what we really know about the existence of other worlds, our origins and the nature of reality itself. I began to question the facts of contemporary belief paradigms to see if there were other possible perspectives that could rationally explain my experiences. Through my questioning I came to realize that the facts were not carved in stone, they were simply assumptions about the nature of reality that many people accepted as fact. My questioning ultimately created enough reasonable doubt regarding mainstream reality interpretations that I could consider the ideas presented in Voyagers in a more objective framework, rather than simply dismiss them because they challenged what I had thought I knew about the nature of reality. I became receptive to the Voyagers material. </p><p>The need to validate my mental integrity was much less important than my need to understand the truth. As I explored the mysteries of human nature I realized that the Voyagers material could quite possibly represent a good portion of the mysterious truth about humanity that is presently unrecognized within our modern culture. I began to take the Voyagers material seriously. Only then did the profound implications of Voyagers really hit me, as I realized that, if this information is valid, we are in a most significant time period. We are approaching an evolutionary crossroads and through our choices the course of our collective future evolution will be determined. I became grateful for the Voyagers material as a potential tool through which effective action could be taken. Voyagers is not the entire truth of human reality, it is not the end of the story through which all mysteries will be solved. This book represents a beginning point, through which we can start to comprehend the incredibly complex framework within which human reality takes place. </p><p>Comparative analysis between contemporary beliefs and those presented in Voyagers led me to realize the potential validity of the new ideas. Once holes in the logic of the old paradigms became apparent, it was much easier to identify the potential logic of the ideas presented in Voyagers. The perspectives offered in Voyagers were equally as rational as those promoted through contemporary belief paradigms. I made peace with the Voyagers material. Peace came as a result of understanding how the ideas in this book could literally be possible and in realizing that this possibility implied that humanity's evolution had a greater purpose, meaning and cause than we presently suppose. I hope the reader may understand the evolutionary promise implied by the Voyagers worldview. It is a promise that reminds us of the majesty of our Divine nature and reaffirms our connection to a sacred Creation.</p></p><h2>Scottish Witches (Waverley Scottish Classics)</h2><p>This bestselling book of Scottish ghosts, superstitions and folklore consists of stories that range in time from the seventeenth century to the recent past.

Here Yoshikuni Igarashi offers a provocative look at how Japanese postwar society struggled to understand its war loss and the resulting national trauma, even as forces within the society sought to suppress these memories. Igarashi argues that Japan's nationhood survived the war's destruction in part through a popular culture that expressed memories of loss and devastation more readily than political discourse ever could. He shows how the desire to represent the past motivated Japan's cultural productions in the first twenty-five years of the postwar period.</p><br><p> Japanese war experiences were often described through narrative devices that downplayed the war's disruptive effects on Japan's history. Rather than treat these narratives as obstacles to historical inquiry, Igarashi reads them along with counter-narratives that attempted to register the original impact of the war. He traces the tensions between remembering and forgetting by focusing on the body as the central site for Japan's production of the past. This approach leads to fascinating discussions of such diverse topics as the use of the atomic bomb, hygiene policies under the U.S. occupation, the monstrous body of Godzilla, the first Western professional wrestling matches in Japan, the transformation of Tokyo and the athletic body for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the writer Yukio Mishima's dramatic suicide, while providing a fresh critical perspective on the war legacy of Japan.</p></p><p><p>"An innovative attempt to trace the "absent presence of war memories" in the cultural discourse of postwar Japan. The author's juxtaposition of examples from different cultural registers is distinctive, persuasive, and provocative, and the book is a pleasure to read."<b>--Carol Gluck, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is history writing at its best. The author maintains a subtle tension between historic continuities and postwar discontinuity, between interpretation and documentation, between political and cultural analysis, between literary and mass cultural analysis, and between the posited and resurrected body of the Japanese nation. His central concern for remembering postwar forgetting takes us from wartime exclusion of the victims of leprosy and mental illness under the Eugenics Law, to the cleansing of the postwar process of discursive formation of the 1950s and 1960s that brought us such figures as Rikid�zan, the Korean wrestler passing for Japanese. The treatment of the Japanese body and of Japanese bodies is a compelling narrative of the "foundational narrative" of the U.S.- Japan relationship that has informed so much of postwar Japanese cultural and economic recovery and forgetting, a remembering of Japanese suffering made possible by the forgetting of the colonized Asian body. <i>Bodies of Memory</i> thus provides a powerful explanation as to why so many in Japan refuse to accept Japan's modern history in Asia. It belongs alongside the new anthropology of Japan that is uncovering the layers of consciousness of postwar Japan, for Igarashi shows us how trauma may have been forgotten but not abandoned."<b>--Miriam Silverberg, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><b>Yoshikuni Igarashi</b> is Assistant Professor of History at Vanderbilt University.</p><h2>Help 3 (Handbook of Exercises for Language Processing)</h2><p>Ages: 6-Adult Thousands of SLPs use these books to help their clients develop the language skills needed for independence.

But through the pain of the months to come, the poetry and logic of India do not leave Una untouched. And it begins with the feather, a promise of something genuine and precious... In The Peacock Spring Rumer Godden evokes the magic of an India she knows so well &#x2013; and all the bitter sweetness of loyalty and love. And in the preface she explains how this perennially popular novel came to be written. &#x2018;One of the finest English novelists&#x2019; Orville Prescott</p><p>Rumer Godden was one of Britain&#39;s most distinguished authors, with many justly famous and much-loved books for both adults and children to her credit, including Black Narcissus and The Greengage Summer .

Throughout this period she kept a diary of personal reflections on, and observations of, this historic time. Because of the outspoken views she published in print and online, Yazbek quickly attracted the attention and fury of the regime, vicious rumours started to spread about her disloyalty to the homeland and the Alawite community to which she belongs. The lyrical narrative describes her struggle to protect herself and her young daughter, even as her activism propels her into a horrifying labyrinth of insecurity after she is forced into living on the run and detained multiple times, excluded from the Alawite community and renounced by her family, her hometown and even her childhood friends. With rare empathy and journalistic prowess Samar Yazbek compiled oral testimonies from ordinary Syrians all over the country. Filled with snapshots of exhilarating hope and horrifying atrocities, she offers us a wholly unique perspective on the Syrian uprising. Hers is a modest yet powerful testament to the strength and commitment of countless unnamed Syrians who have united to fight for their freedom. These diaries will inspire all those who read them, and challenge the world to look anew at the trials and tribulations of the Syrian uprising.</p><p>Samar Yazbek is a Syrian writer and journalist, born in Jableh in 1970. She is the author of several works of fiction. An outspoken critic of the Assad regime, but also of what she identifies as erroneous perceptions of ideological conformity within the Syrian Alawite community, Yazbek has been deeply involved in the Syrian uprising since it broke out in March, 2011. Fearing for the life of her daughter she was forced to flee her country and now lives in hiding. Yazbek was awarded the PEN/Pinter International Writer of Courage Award in 2012, awarded to an author of outstanding literary merit who casts an &#39;unflinching&#39; eye on the world. She is also the author of the novel Cinnamon (2012).&#x201c;The best account of the revolution&#x2019;s early months.&#x201d; (<i>National</i>)</p><h2>An Analysis of Leon Festinger&#39;s A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Leon Festinger&#x2019;s 1957 <em>A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance</em> is a key text in the history of psychology &#x2013; one that made its author one of the most influential social psychologists of his time. It is also a prime example of how creative thinking and problem solving skills can come together to produce work that changes the way people look at questions for good. </p> <p>Strong creative thinkers are able to look at things from a new perspective, often to the point of challenging the very frames in which those around them see things. Festinger was such a creative thinker, leading what came to be known as the &#x201c;cognitive revolution&#x201d; in social psychology. When Festinger was carrying out his research, the dominant school of thought &#x2013; behaviorism &#x2013; focused on outward behaviors and their effects. Festinger, however, turned his attention elsewhere, looking at &#x201c;cognition:&#x201d; the mental processes behind behaviors. In the case of &#x201c;cognitive dissonance&#x201d;, for example, he hypothesized that apparently incomprehensible or illogical behaviors might be caused by a cognitive drive away from dissonance, or internal contradiction. This perspective, however, raised a problem: how to examine and test out cognitive processes. Festinger&#x2019;s book records the results of the psychological experiments he designed to solve that problem. The results helped prove the existence for what is now a fundamental theory in social psychology.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Camille Morvan</strong> is a pyschology researcher and founder of the psychological human resources company Goshaba.

While critics have lauded Wagner's <em>Tristan and Isolde</em> for the originality and subtlety of the music, they have denounced the drama as a "mere trifle"--a rendering of Wagner's forbidden love for Matilde Wesendonck, the wife of a banker who supported him during his exile in Switzerland.<br><br><em>Death-Devoted Heart</em> explodes this established interpretation, proving the drama to be more than just a sublimation of the composer's love for Wesendonck or a wistful romantic dream. Scruton boldly attests that <em>Tristan and Isolde</em> has profound religious meaning and remains as relevant today as it was to Wagner's contemporaries. He also offers keen insight into the nature of erotic love, the sacred qualities of human passion, and the peculiar place of the erotic in our culture. His argument touches on the nature of tragedy, the significance of ritual sacrifice, and the meaning of redemption, providing a fresh interpretation of Wagner's masterpiece. Roger Scruton has written an original and provocative account of Wagner's music drama, which blends philosophy, criticism, and musicology in order to show the work's importance in the twenty-first century.<br></p><p><br><strong>Roger Scruton</strong> is a well-known writer, philosopher, journalist, and a former professor of philosophy. He has written more than thirty books on aesthetics, culture, and politics.<br><br>"For those who wish to wrestle with religious and philosophical interpretations, Scruton provides ample grist and excellent analysis of the story and music."- <em>The Opera Journal</em><p></p><br>"This is possibly the best book ever written about <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> from the dramatic as well as the musical point of view. Scruton does not leave a historical stone unturned without dusting and exposing it to the sunlight of his extraordinary power of synthesis. And his musical analysis is phenomenal. Even if you do not read music it has plenty to grab your attention. I would buy it just for the chapter on chivalry and courtly love, for instance, in which Scruton's clairy of narration and research put many other writers to shame.... A book the reader does not want to put down."--Eduardo Benarroch<p></p><br>"A wide-ranging analysis of Richard Wagner's influential tribute to romantic love, by a noted philosopher and social critic.... Scruton's status as an unusually accomplished polymath is apparent throughout <em>Death-Devoted Heart</em>, as he moves easily from topic to topic, discussing such figures as Geoffrey Chaucer, Arthur Schopenhauer, Plato, Chretien de Troyes, and Claude Levi-Strauss with equal aplomb." -- <em>Magill's Literary Annual 2005</em><p></p><br>"Roger Scruton's <em>Death-Devoted Heart</em> is an elegant, erudite exploration attempting to make the operagoer 'get' this piece and, by extension, Wagner's intent in all of his <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> ventures. Scruton shows us that traditional dismissals of <em>Tristan</em>'s brief plot as Wagner's self-therapy in the wake of a frustrated love affair miss the point...Scruton is more interested in our understanding the philosophical substrate...devoting chapters to Wagner's conceptions of love, sacrifice and redemption, and ritual."--<em>Books &amp; Culture</em><p></p><br>"Scruton has prepared his brief with care. Medieval chivalric romance, Kantian ethics, anthropological mythography, and musicological close-work propel his sinuous but lucid argument...<em>Death-Devoted Heart</em> is a breathtaking book."--<em>First Things</em><p></p><br>"If you're going to disagree with Nietzsche, Plato and Schopenhauer, you'd best have your own house in order. Roger Scruton certainly does."--<em>Opera News</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating book, conveying his ideas so effectively he almost makes us hear the music...Scruton is full of engaging subtleties...written with his customary clarity and concision."--<em>The Sunday Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"Impressive new book...this distinguished, characteristically contentious book sets a standard of Wagnerian commentary which it would be a great relief to see other writers attempting to follow."--<em>The Spectator</em><p></p><br>"Roger Scruton's book is a deep and daunting study of the most important single composition in Western music, Richard Wagner's <em>Tristan and Isolde</em>...Scruton's examination is highly original and delves into aspects which have seldom been explored so rigorously."--<em>The Independent</em><p></p><br>"Scruton's new book, <em>Death-Devoted Heart: Sex and the Sacred in Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde,"</em> connects the opera in an informative way with sex and religion and shows how many primitive religions associate sex with God. Scruton also examines the drama in this opera in interesting ways and notes how Wagner wanted the medieval setting of this opera to be taken very seriously." <em>The Opera Quarterly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>To Kill a Mockingbird: The Themes � The Characters � The Language and Style � The Plot Analyzed (Literature Made Easy)</h2><p>If you're looking for an explanation of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>'s themes, plot points, character actions and motivations, plus discussions of Harper Lee's unique literary style and point of view, reach for the <i>Literature Made Easy Series</i>.

Eddy and the History of Christian Science</h2><p>This controversial biography of the founder of the Christian Science church was serialized in McClure's Magazine in 1907-8 and published as a book the next year. It disappeared almost overnight and has been difficult to find ever since.

Ten years in the making, <i>Meeting God</i> is the culmination of Huyler's travels throughout the Indian subcontinent, documenting in vivid photographs the panoply of Hindu devotional practices. What distinguishes <i>Meeting God</i> is its intimacy--through his glossy color photos and vignettes of individual Hindus practicing their rituals, he takes the reader into a world that pulses with the power of faith. The crux of the book is <i>puja</i>, daily devotional practices that anchor Hindus in the divinity of the universe, whether that person is a farmer, carpenter, engineer, or housewife. The remarkable array of different <i>puja</i> don't seem to interfere with modern life in India, and, as Huyler insists, actually enhance it. Given the vacuity of meaning in our own modern world, each page of <i>Meeting God</i> is an inspiration to deepen life. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"This is a book that simply glows with light and life. The Hindu world that Stephen Huyler shows is luminous, suffused with spirituality, and deeply inspiring."&#x2014;Deepak Chopra "A full color tour of India through the eyes and lens of a noted historian-photographer."&#x2014;Bill Broadway, Washington Post "An engaging story book, an exquisite photo journey into the heart of India and especially, a superb overview of the ways and whys of Hindu worship."&#x2014;Hinduism Today</p><h2>Calculus of Variations with Applications (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>This introductory text offers a far-reaching, rigorous, application-oriented approach to variational theory that will increase students' understanding of more specialized books and research papers in the field. The treatment acquaints readers with basic methodology, selecting a path through classical conditions for an extremum, modern existence theory, and problems of recent origin and with novel features. Numerous examples from engineering, physics, and other diverse areas receive full treatment.<br>The first six chapters require no special preparation beyond a familiarity with advanced calculus. Chapter 1 features a survey of the prerequisite concepts and results, which may be consulted as needed. Subsequent chapters demand greater mathematical maturity, drawing from the fields of modern real analysis, theory of differential equations, functional analysis, and topology. However, the book is sufficiently self-contained that those without such a background can still master much of the second half.

In his day Jefferson not only planned but also worked in the gardens at Monticello, aided by his family members, slaves, and European workers. His delight in gardening is also revealed in his correspondence with leading horticulturists worldwide, bringing to Virginia curiosities such as peppers from Mexico, figs from France, and bean varieties collected by the Lewis and Clark expedition. Jefferson family letters are filled with a "garden gossip" that belies a child-like enthusiasm for the strawberries, tulips, and sugar maples at home. Of course, the greatest evidence of Jefferson's horticultural passion thrives in the restored gardens at Monticello, admired the world over.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thomas Jefferson's Garden Book documents his varied approaches to gardening, whether as landscape architect, pleasure gardener, or horticultural scientist. In his Garden Book, the horticultural diary which he kept from 1766 until 1824, Jefferson noted such observations as how the gardens were sown, the extent of frost damage to his and other area gardens, and when vegetables came "to table."</p><p></p><p></p><p>To these detailed but lapsing records, the late Edwin Morris Betts, professor of biology at the University of Virginia, added his own commentary, as well as selections from Jefferson's other writings--compelling letters, unpublished memoranda, sketches, and related entries from Jefferson's Farm, Account, Weather, and Memorandum Books. Completing this collection is a new introduction by Peter J. Hatch, Director of Gardens and Grounds at Monticello for more than two decades.</p><p></p></p><p>Edwin Morris Betts (1892-1958) was professor of biology at the University of Virginia for thirty-one years.

In an era when we're lucky to glean one or two<br>inspiring ideas from a book of nonfiction, Delta Willis has packed this one<br>with dozens- possibility space, tensegrity, morphodynamics... And the details:<br>did you know that a fly has a three-speed gear shift for its wings? Or that<br>the branches of an oak tree are frequently longer than the tree's height? Nature's<br>designs are not always ideal, but they have uncanny ways of dealing with the<br>conditions of this planet, using a great economy of means. The author introduces<br>us in a very personal way to the researchers, inventors, and engineers who've<br>tried to understand and/or use nature's schemes, and continue to do so. At<br>the center of the book is the patriarch of "growth and form," D'Arcy<br>Thompson, whose legacy is perhaps still not fully realized. His predecessors<br>(Leonardo da Vinci, Fibonacci...) and successors (Fuller, Seilacher...) are<br>juxtaposed more on the basis of pertinence than conventional plodding chronology.<br>The author shows a natural playfulness, weaving her own experiences into the<br>explanations, and allowing her personages to speak for themselves. Dolf Seilacher's<br>words occasionally shows signs of nature experimenting on the spot.<br>In the spirit of her controlling metaphor, the sand dollar, Willis gives immediate<br>delight like the flower design etched on a sand dollar's back, and deftly reveals<br>the underlying intrigue such as the sand dollar's intricate food grooves, tube<br>feet, and system of sand ballast under the thin etched dome. Faced with this<br>abundant evidence of genius in nature's designs, I found myself asking what<br>exactly this genius could be. As Stephen Jay Gould has said, these are "paths that<br>a sensible God would never tread." But while physical laws describe a trend<br>to disorder (entropy), life plays with designs and moves toward greater order,<br>as if consciousness were not an exclusive property of the brain.

Do you appeal to their bonds with their fellow soldiers, their patriotism, their desire to end tyranny and mass murder? Certainly&#x2014;but if you&#x2019;re the US Army in 1944, you also try another tack: you dangle the lure of beautiful French women, waiting just on the other side of the wire, ready to reward their liberators in oh so many ways.</p> <p><br> That&#x2019;s not the picture of the Greatest Generation that we&#x2019;ve been given, but it&#x2019;s the one Mary Louise Roberts paints to devastating effect in <i>What Soldiers Do</i>. Drawing on an incredible range of sources, including news reports, propaganda and training materials, official planning documents, wartime diaries, and memoirs, Roberts tells the fascinating and troubling story of how the US military command systematically spread&#x2014;and then exploited&#x2014;the myth of French women as sexually experienced and available. The resulting chaos&#x2014;ranging from flagrant public sex with prostitutes to outright rape and rampant venereal disease&#x2014;horrified the war-weary and demoralized French population. The sexual predation, and the blithe response of the American military leadership, also caused serious friction between the two nations just as they were attempting to settle questions of long-term control over the liberated territories and the restoration of French sovereignty. </p> <p><br> While never denying the achievement of D-Day, or the bravery of the soldiers who took part, <i>What Soldiers Do</i> reminds us that history is always more useful&#x2014;and more interesting&#x2014;when it is most honest, and when it goes beyond the burnished beauty of nostalgia to grapple with the real lives and real mistakes of the people who lived it.</p></p><p><b>Mary Louise Roberts</b> is professor of history at the University of Wisconsin and the author of <i>Disruptive Acts: The New Woman in Fin de Si�cle France</i> and <i>Civilization without Sexes: Reconstructing Gender in Post-war France, 1918&#x2013;1928</i>.<br><p>&#x201c;In this vivid account of GIs in wartime France, Mary Lou Roberts documents how the Greatest Generation was sometimes as badly behaved beyond the battlefield as it was brave in combat. <i>What Soldiers Do </i>is not a conventional history. It deeply&#x2014;and often colorfully&#x2014;textures our understanding of the experiences of men at war, the contours of mid-twentieth-century sexual (and racial) mores, and the frequently ignorant and even lurid attitudes toward other peoples that attended America's ascent to global hegemony.&#x201d;</p> (David M.

It will provoke heated discussion and critical responses from those who are made uncomfortable by its arguments, and those arguments merit engagement both by those who agree and by those who might not want to face the evidence that the author has gathered so expertly.

A powerful reminder of the dark side of the liberation.<i>"</i> (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Throughout this book the links between sex, the body, national and transnational politics are made plain. While some readers may query the argument that the behaviour of GIs can be conceptualised as the 'growing pains' of a nation moving into world leadership, many will appreciate this nuanced history of sex, war and power. The sexual behaviour of an army, and the sexual abuse it propagates, are to do with more than the personal choices of select individuals. Looking beyond 'a few bad hats', as British Army officers are wont to say of abusers, is instructive, not just for a deeper understanding of the complex liberation of France but also of the broader links between military power, sexual dominance and gender relations.&#x201d;</p><p></p> (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"An excellent example of how attention to gender, sexuality, and race transforms understanding of historical processes."

I did my undergraduate work at Lindenwood, which was then a women's college in St. Charles, Missouri. I got married right after college, moved to Dallas, got a master's in history at Southern Methodist University, and had my son, Paul, there. Eventually I moved back to Arkansas and got divorced. </p><p> <b><i>Later, you married Ed. How did the two of you meet?</i></b><br> I met Ed on a blind date in Little Rock. It was the only blind date I'd ever gone on. Ed was living in Bolinas, California, at the time. Every year he visited some neighbors down the street, and every year, they fixed Ed up with a different woman. I was Ms. 1979! Two months later, I quit my job, gave away everything I owned except my son, and moved to Bolinas to be with Ed. </p><p> <b><i>Two decades later, what made you and Ed decide to go to Kosovo?</i></b><br> Going to Kosovo was Ed's idea. He really wanted to do something-even a little something-to help in the Balkans. When he told me he wanted to take a leave of absence to go to Kosovo I was terrified and appalled. Afraid of the unknown, really. Reluctant to leave my friends and family and home. But as the weeks went on and we talked about it more, and I realized how much it meant to Ed, I just started getting us ready for the move. I loved Ed, he wanted this deeply, so I supported him. He would have supported me if I had wanted something that badly. It's that simple. <br><br> But it was not "my" trip, too, until I got to Kosovo. When I got there, when I met my neighbors, our landlords, Isa and Igaballe, Ed's staff, my students. . . when I got to know more about what had happened in Kosovo, what the people had endured. . . then it was no longer just Ed's trip. It became mine, too. <br><br> I will always be grateful to Ed for wanting to go to Kosovo. </p><p> <b><i>What was it like when you first arrived in Prishtina? How long did it take you to get used to the presence of tanks in the streets, soldiers and policemen everywhere, the bombed-out homes?</i></b><br> I got used to it all very, very quickly. Within a week or two, looking at the tanks, the sandbagged fortifications, the international police and the NATO troops carrying automatic weapons was like looking at the lamppost. That may sound flip, but somehow that's what happened. <br><br> For one thing, I could see that the Kosovo Albanians around me were so relieved and grateful to have NATO troops and armaments there. After all, these were the forces that drove the Serb oppressors from Kosovo, and that remained in order to keep the peace in the region. These forces represented peace, not war, to the local inhabitants. <br><br> And remember that Prishtina had not been destroyed, unlike much of the rest of Kosovo. The Serbs needed Prishtina, the capital city, so although there was massive looting and vandalism, and, of course, murders and the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population of the city, they had left most of the buildings intact. <br><br> The bombed buildings in the middle of the city were largely the result of NATO's surgical air strikes-that completely destroyed Serb police headquarters, for instance-that I walked past each day on my way to school. It had been a huge five- or six-story complex, and was now collapsing in on itself, the walls blasted out, a charred skeleton of a building. Most of the destruction in Prishtina was below the surface-in the hearts and minds of the residents. I saw this every day, and I never got used to that destruction. As I began to concentrate on the people I met, which I did very quickly, physical surroundings just didn't seem important. </p><p> <b><i>You taught English to a group of Kosovo Albanians. Why were they interested in learning English?</i></b><br> You have to realize just how far down the educational and economic ladder Kosovo Albanians are. My students-every Kosovo Albanian, really-had essentially lost ten years of their lives, those awful years of apartheid under Milosevic. My students and their families were desperate to escape the consequences of generations of isolation and poverty, and a decade of brutal oppression. They knew they had to catch up with the West, and catch up fast. My students knew that their families were, in effect, sending them out into the world as the family's emissaries, as the family's last best chance to pull themselves up and out. If they didn't make it, their entire family might never make it. Knowledge of the English language is one of the most important passports to the rest of the world. It is the second language of much of the world, it is the language of business and commerce. In Kosovo itself it is the language used by UNMIK and most non-governmental organizations. And, of course, good English is necessary if the young people are to study in England or the U.S. It's not an exaggeration to say that English, in many ways, is key to the economic advancement of my students and their families. </p><p> <b><i>You taught history when you were in your twenties. Did that background help you with your students in Kosovo?</i></b><br> My background as a teacher didn't help at all. It had been so long ago. What did help me was the short course I took in TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language). The course reacquainted me with my native language and gave me some interesting, entertaining teaching techniques. <br><br> The second thing that helped me was simply my fifty-six years of life experience. I had learned things from just living that were more helpful to me than anything I had learned in a classroom-things like patience, a sense of humor, and the importance of listening. Also, I'd had different kinds of work experience, and my students wanted to know about that. They wanted to learn how to work. They felt that Americans knew how to work, and they wanted more of that in their own culture. </p><p> <b><i>What inspired you to introduce the idea of a book club to your students? </i></b><br> From the moment I met my students and realized how eager they were to learn, I knew I wanted to give them something special. I wanted to do more for them than just teach English grammar-though that was important, too. <br><br> I thought of my book club in Bolinas-the camaraderie we have with one another, how we use the book club to have conversations about things that mattered to us, to share experiences in our lives, both the happy times and the sad times. I thought, well, perhaps I could create a book club for my students. It would give them a chance for extra conversation practice, and it would provide a means of getting to know each other better. It also, I thought, might provide them with a safe forum in which they could express things they needed to express. </p><p> <b><i>Was the book club an immediate success?</i></b><br> The book club was a wonderful thing just in itself-as a club, as a place to discuss The Old Man and the Sea and American literature. But it was much more than that. The club became the class and vice versa. The spirit and camaraderie, the intimacy, the trust we found in the club came into the classroom. I think the students saw that I was offering myself to them in more ways than just as their English teacher. They saw that I was willing to go an extra mile-maybe many extra miles - for them. They began to trust me, and for me, and I think for the students, the class became a family. </p><p> <b><i>Your students were very affected by </i>The Old Man and the Sea. <i>Why did this book resonate so much for them?</i></b><br> I think the book resonated on several levels. It was such a simple story, fairly easy for most of them to read. Also, it's a fable. It's a fable of the triumph of hope and courage over adversity. For the students, the book was the story of their personal lives, of their country. On that level, it resonated deeply for them. </p><p> My students also loved the old man's relationship with the young boy. It's the teacher-student relationship, the mentor-apprentice relationship. And I think that that relationship allowed them to think about their families-the older people in their families, whom they revere. They spoke to me of their grandparents, their older aunts and uncles, who had come through the years of apartheid and ethnic cleansing with "eyes that were cheerful and undefeated." I think my students felt that <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was their story. And we mustn't forget that The Old Man and the Sea is simply a great story! It's a tender and exciting and suspenseful story. We all love a story like that. </p><p> <b><i>In your conversations with your students, they often expressed a deep, almost worshipful love for Americans. How did you feel about that?</i></b><br> In Kosovo, as my students and others told me of their love for America, I found myself thinking about my country in a way I never had before. I discovered how much I love my country. And for the first time, really, I found myself looking carefully at my country's strengths and weaknesses. I found, for instance, that I am very proud of our intervention in Kosovo-proud of the fact that President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright, along with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, led NATO in driving the Serb military from Kosovo. We made mistakes in that war, but the intervention itself was the right thing to do. Leonard told me when I went back to visit in the spring of 2002, "I do not doubt that if NATO had not driven the Serbs from Kosovo I would be dead now." <br><br> And I found myself feeling proud of the diversity in America-proud of the fact that we have people from all over the world, every race, ethnicity, religion. We are a big jumbled mass of colors and beliefs and origins but we are all Americans, and we value our special jumble. Our strength comes from our diversity. It wasn't until I lived in the Balkans, where many people really want to live in mono-ethnic states, that I realized how important diversity is, and how lucky we are in America to live with such a mix of peoples. <br><br> But I thought, too, about America's failures and problems. I thought about how we failed to intervene when we should have in Bosnia and Rwanda. And I thought about the racism, poverty, and inequality that still exist in the U.S. I talked with my students about these things. Shangri-la doesn't exist anywhere on the planet, not even in America, I told them. The problems of prejudice and poverty, of greed and complacency exist everywhere-everyone in every country must struggle constantly to overcome these problems. <br><br> Pico Iyer, one of my favorite writers on the subject of travel, says we must treat other people's dreams with tenderness. We don't want to dash illusions that sustain other people, yet we don't want to foster false notions of a "land of milk and honey," either. I tried to let my students know that, yes, America is a wonderful country, but it's not a perfect country, and that we all must work every day to make it a better place for everyone. How do your students feel about Serbs? How do they feel about the future of Kosovo? There is hatred in Kosovo for the Serbs-lots of it. It is fueled by fear, by the memories of the atrocities perpetrated by the Serb military and paramilitaries. But what my students seem to be focused on is now-the wonderful freedom of "now"-and the future. They're simply not going to be derailed by feelings of self-pity or hatred or revenge. I wonder, could I be so courageous? So optimistic? I'm not so sure. <br><br> When I went back to Kosovo in the spring of 2002, many of the Kosovars I talked with seemed to have accepted the inevitability of living with other ethnic groups, even Serbs. They know that to be accepted as a country, and as part of Western Europe, the European Union, they must embrace western standards-and one of those standards is multi-culturalism, multi-ethnicity. <br><br> What some Kosovars told me during my last visit is that they want only Serbs with "clean hands" to return to Kosovo. "Is it fair," one of my Kosovo Albanian friends asked me, "that the Serb neighbors who burned down my house return now to their house and we live as if nothing happened?" Clean hands, they say. <br><br> But dirty hands, clean hands-who will decide? It will take only a few murders of returning Serbs to destroy the effort for multi-ethnicity and ruin Kosovo's chances-ruin the chances for my students-to become a stable, prosperous part of Europe. The situation has been made more difficult by Serbian leaders' refusal to assume responsibility or apologize for the atrocious crimes committed in the name of the Serbian people in the '90s. Needless to say, Ed and I are very concerned. </p><p> <b><i>How do you feel about the future of Kosovo?</i></b><br> Learning to live in a democratic society is difficult. One of the things Kosovars will need to learn is that western-style democracy is set up to protect minorities, to provide equal protection under the law for everyone. It takes most countries a long time to learn this-and I think that even in America we have to keep relearning it every day. In times of stress and fear, even in the U.S., it is very easy to let this value slip away, to compromise on the commitment to protect everyone equally. Kosovo will be judged by how well it (with an Albanian majority of some 90 percent) protects Serbs, Roma (gypsies), and other minority groups. Are they up to this? I hope so. Everything depends on it. <br><br> Also, the notion of collective guilt, collective innocence is behind many of the problems in Kosovo-and all over the world, for that matter. It's that insidious idea of stereotyping that the students and I discussed in English class one day. Can we say: "All white people are . . ." "All Catholics are . . ." "All Muslims are . . ." "All Americans are . . ." "All Serbs are . . ." "All Albanians are . . ."? No. We have to begin to say the words "some," "many," and "a few," so we can begin to see each other as individual human beings rather than merely faceless members of a group. <br><br> What will happen to Kosovo? Will it be given independence? I don't know. But I do believe that, after all that has happened to them, most Kosovo Albanians will not willingly submit to Serbian rule again. </p><p> <b><i>The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is the result of a journal you kept in Kosovo. Had you always kept journals?</i></b><br> No, not at all. Almost every New Year's, I make a resolution that I'm going to keep a daily journal. That lasts about a week. I didn't start keeping a journal until we decided to go to Kosovo. I knew from the beginning that I was going to want to remember every event, every conversation, every single thing I saw. I kept the journal in four different handwritten notebooks and a laptop. I carried a notebook in my purse so I could record conversations soon after they occurred, and make them part of my journal each night. </p><p> <b><i>When you started keeping your Kosovo journal, did you ever imagine that thousands of people would be reading it someday?</i></b><br> No, I never imagined that.

The American public&#39;s perception of crime is out of line with crime reality. One consequence of such misinformation on the prevalence of violent crime is that many people are more afraid of being the victim of a violent crime than they realistically should be. Myths and Realities of Crime and Justice: What Every American Should Know provides readers with an accurate and up-to-date picture of crime and justice in America. It presents many recent findings from criminologists and criminal justice practitioners and debunks common misconceptions.</p><p>Steven E.

In narrative terms, it's fairly slight: a sun-washed fairytale, delicious in its contrivance. But it's also a paean to the transformative power of travel. Four very different women respond to an advertisement in the Times appealing to "those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine" to rent a small medieval Italian castle for a month. Mrs Wilkins and Mrs Arbuthnot, the original two respondents, are joined in their act of escape by the youthful Lady Caroline, whose beauty and general melodiousness have become something of a burden to her, and the formidable Mrs Fisher, who insists that everyone think of her "just as an old lady with a stick" as she sets about imposing her will on the rest. Each one is vaguely unsatisfied with their lot and Mrs Wilkins and Mrs Arbuthnot both have marriages of quiet English unhappiness. Von Arnim has an eye for small human failings, the little acts of pettiness and selfishness in which most people indulge. She is perceptive about the way people misread one another's good, and not so good intentions, and the early chapters read like a comedy of miscommunication. She also &#x2013; perhaps not surprisingly, given her famed German garden &#x2013; revels in the descriptions of the castle grounds and their beauty and colour. The climate and the castle eventually start to have an effect on the four women. Their perceptions shift and they wake up to the love in their lives. The writing loses some of its wryness and bite in the later chapters, but the happy ending is no less magical for its predictability.</p><p>A discrete advertisement in <i>The Times</i>, addressed to �those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine,� is the prelude to a revelatory month for four very different women. High above a bay on the Italian Riviera stands the medieval castle San Salvatore. Beckoned to this haven are Mrs. Wilkins, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Mrs. Fisher, and Lady Caroline Dester, each quietly craving a respite. Lulled by the gentle spirit of the Mediterranean, they gradually shed their public skins, discovering a harmony each of them has longed for but none has ever known. First published in 1922, this captivating novel is imbued with the descriptive power and lighthearted irreverence for which Elizabeth von Arnim is renowned.Elizabeth von Arnim Russell (1866&#x2013;1941), born Mary Annette Beauchamp, was an Australian-born British novelist. By marriage she became Gr�fin (Countess) von Arnim-Schlagenthin, and by a second marriage, Countess Russell. Although known in her early life as Mary, "after the publication of her first book, she was known to her readers, eventually to her friends, and finally even to her family as Elizabeth." and she is now invariably referred to as Elizabeth von Arnim. She also wrote under the pen name Alice Cholmondeley. In 1898 she started her literary career by publishing Elizabeth and Her German Garden, a semi-autobiographical novel about a rural idyll published anonymously and, as it turned out to be highly successful, reprinted 20 times within the first year. Von Arnim wrote another 20 books, which were all published "By the author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden". Enchanted April was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated feature film, directed by Mike Newell, in 1992, and a Tony Award-nominated stage play by Matthew Barber, in 2003. Her book Mr. Skeffington was made into a movie starring Bette Davis and Claude Rains in 1944.</p><h2>Applied Functional Analysis (Pure and Applied Mathematics)</h2><p>A novel, practical introduction to functional analysis<br> <br> In the twenty years since the first edition of Applied Functional Analysis was published, there has been an explosion in the number of books on functional analysis. Yet none of these offers the unique perspective of this new edition. Jean-Pierre Aubin updates his popular reference on functional analysis with new insights and recent discoveries-adding three new chapters on set-valued analysis and convex analysis, viability kernels and capture basins, and first-order partial differential equations. He presents, for the first time at an introductory level, the extension of differential calculus in the framework of both the theory of distributions and set-valued analysis, and discusses their application for studying boundary-value problems for elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations and for systems of first-order partial differential equations.<br> <br> To keep the presentation concise and accessible, Jean-Pierre Aubin introduces functional analysis through the simple Hilbertian structure. He seamlessly blends pure mathematics with applied areas that illustrate the theory, incorporating a broad range of examples from numerical analysis, systems theory, calculus of variations, control and optimization theory, convex and nonsmooth analysis, and more. Finally, a summary of the essential theorems as well as exercises reinforcing key concepts are provided. Applied Functional Analysis, Second Edition is an excellent and timely resource for both pure and applied mathematicians.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE AUBIN, PhD, is a professor at the Universit� Paris-Dauphine in Paris, France.

Valley Curtain stretched 1,250 feet across a valley in Rifle, Colorado; Wrapped Coast covered a mile and a half of Australian coastline with a million square feet of fabric; The Umbrellas deployed 3,100 umbrellas set in Japan and California, each nearly twenty feet tall; Surrounded Islands encircled eleven islands in Biscayne Bay, Florida with six and a half million square feet of bright pink fabric; and Wrapped Reichstag enveloped the entire German parliament in shimmering silver fabric.<br><br>For more than forty years, these and many other works by Christo and Jeanne-Claude have reconceived the art of the possible, turned natural and human monuments-streets, bridges, hills, trees, buildings, parks, and islands-into sculptures and paintings, and created dazzling new landscapes and startling new vistas. Often requiring years, even decades, of preparation and planning, these works-not merely feats of aesthetic daring but engineering and organizational marvels-exist for only a few weeks or less. Yet what makes these transient creations linger forever in the mind is their overwhelming and magisterial beauty. They are, in every sense, transformative, and, for the millions who have experienced them in person, unforgettable. <br><br>Christo and Jeanne-Claude have been the frequent subjects of films, videos, catalogues, cartoons, monographs, exhibitions, and editorials. Until this biography by Burt Chernow, however, written with the full cooperation of the artists, nothing has connected the intimate details of their lives and the spectacular dimensions of their projects. Christo, the penniless Bulgarian refugee who made his way to Paris during the 1950s, and Jeanne-Claude, the socialite daughter of a prominent French general, seemed an unlikely couple, yet together they forged one of the most enduring partnerships in contemporary art. When they arrived in New York in 1964, Christo was already becoming well known in avant-garde circles for his wrappings of everyday objects; Jeanne-Claude acted as manager, dealer, and accountant. Over time, as Chernow reveals, the fusion of their prodigious gifts-his drawings and her ability to draw things together-produced the works for which today they are known the world over. <br>Chernow recounts their rise from relative obscurity to international renown, revealing both the sources of their art and the heights to which it has quite literally aspired. An epilogue by Wolfgang Volz, a longtime and close collaborator of the artists, as well as their exclusive photographer, provides a fascinating insider's view of what it is like to work, and dream, with them. <i>Christo and Jeanne-Claude</i> is an indelible portrait of the artists and their work, and a moving account of an extraordinary couple.<br></p><p>Take two intertwined lives marked by childhood turmoil, geographic displacement, fierce ambition, and total dedication to a quixotic form of art, add a lively narrative style and you have <i>Christo and Jeanne-Claude</i> by Burt Chernow. In 1959, French socialite Jeanne-Claude fell in love with a penniless Bulgarian portrait artist just beginning to wrap small objects in canvas. She had no way of knowing that her life would one day involve a constant round of negotiations with politicians, government agencies, fabricators, factory owners, truckers, laborers, farmers, and everyone else whose good will, expertise, or elbow grease were needed to make Christo's gigantic projects happen. Chernow seasons this cheerfully uncritical authorized biography of the masterminds of such projects as "Running Fence" and the "Wrapped Reichstag" with evocative sketches of the '60s art world. An epilogue by Wolfgang Volz, a photographer close to the couple, engrossingly recounts their struggles and triumphs in the '80s and '90s. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>"Christo and Jeanne-Claude are as much adventurers and gamblers as artists. They love the action. There is something of the mischievous child in them, devising then accepting their own near-impossible dares. They are guerrillas dedicated to subversion, their schemes greeted with disbelief. Perhaps they find perverse delight in watching jaws drop as people hear of their plans to build a fabric-covered processional through their hometown park, surround islands with flaming pink fabric, construct a gargantum structure in the desert, or wrap a bridge, monument, or government building. Taking on greater odds, their ideas appear simultaneously familiar and wildly alien, evident yet enormously complicated, obvious but rich in ironic subtexts."<br>&#x2014; Burt Chernow <br></p><h2>A Guide to Bird Finding West of the Mississippi</h2><p>Describes the ornithology of each state and provides information on important bird concentrations</p><p></p><h2>The Worm Ouroboros: A Romance</h2><p>Lord Juss of Demonland leads the weary survivors of his army to destroy the power of Witchland and rescue Goldry Bluszco.</p><p>Eddison&#39;s books are written in a meticulously recreated Jacobean prose style, seeded throughout with fragments, often acknowledged but often directly copied from his favorite authors and genres: Homer and Sappho, Shakespeare and Webster, Norse sagas and French medieval lyric poems.

Mr. Brzezinski who is on leave from his post as Professor and Director of the Research Institute on Communist Affairs, Columbia University serving on State Department's Policy Planning Council, has revised and updated his important study wherever necessary and added three new chapters on recent developments. He gives particular attention to the Sino-Soviet dispute.</p><p>This distinguished book analyzes the origins, evolution, and fragmentation of the once unified Communist world. Though the focus is still on relations between the Soviet Union and the East European countries, there is an expanded treatment of the Sino-Soviet dispute. With skill and insight, Brzezinski traces the transformation of the Soviet bloc into a more complicated alliance system, in which Moscow plays a leading, but no longer unchallenged, role. This is a masterful account of the interaction between ideology and power among the Communist states. An original and incisive analysis of the dynamics of leadership in the Communist camp and of the national factors that condition this leadership. Brzezinski&#39;s definitive work on the rise and dissolution of the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe... is compellingly lucid, unfolds effortlessly, and remains happily unencumbered by �argon. The first edition . . . was one of the significant pioneering efforts in systematizing the analysis of Communism in Eastern Europe, yet it had all the hallmarks of authorship by a profoundly political thinker. The present Revised and Enlarged Edition, more than ever, uses a political approach toward essentially political phenomena in a part of the world which traditionally thinks in political terms... reveals an encyclopaedic grasp of contemporary developments.</p><h2>Restoring Classic &amp; Collectible Cameras</h2><p>Expert advice for turning old cameras into valuable collectibles, these step-by-step instructions show how to restore a vintage camera.

Domhoff argues that the owners and top-level managers in large income-producing properties are far and away the dominant figures in the U.S. Their corporations, banks, and agribusinesses come together as a corporate community that dominates the federal government in Washington and their real estate, construction, and land development companies form growth coalitions that dominate most local governments. By providing empirical evidence for his argument, Domhoff encourages students to think critically about the power structure in American society and its implications for our democracy.</p><p></p><h2>Adirondack French Louie: Early Life in the North Woods</h2><p>Harvey Dunham&#39;s Adirondack French Louie has become an Adirondack classic.

Jeremy Salt offers the background essential for understanding the Middle East today by chronicling the long and bloody history of Western intervention in Arab lands. In lucid detail, he examines the major events that have shaped the region&#x2014;ranging from the French in Algeria and the British in Egypt in the nineteenth century to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and to the continuing war in Iraq. Linking all of these together, Salt paints a damning picture of a sustained campaign by Western powers to dominate the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Throughout, he emphasizes the human cost of the policies put in place to preserve "Western interests" or in the name of bringing civilization, democracy, or freedom to the region. Making use of extensive research in U.S. and British archives that reveals what politicians were deciding behind closed doors, and why, this is a book that will change the way we see the Middle East.</p><p>"Devastating in its portrayal of the depths to which the West (France, Britain, and the US especially) sank in conquering the Middle East. Starting off with Huntington's quote about 'Islam's bloody borders,' Salt argues that it was the West that made these borders bloody, though in the process it had no trouble finding native accomplices who helped, wittingly or not."&#x2014;Mehran Kamrava, author of <i>The Modern Middle East</i><br><br>"This will be of much use to general readers who are ill-served by the preponderance of books in the marketplace that explain political events by recourse to stereotypical representations of 'Arabs' and 'Islam,' while neglecting important historical events that define current political and social reality in the region. None of the general history books on the Middle East offer comparable comprehensive details."&#x2014;Joseph A. Massad, author of <i>Desiring Arabs</i><br><br>"This excellent book is comprehensive in scope, scholarly and yet highly readable. Focusing on the damaging role of western policy in the Middle East, well exemplified in the current debacle in Iraq. It will be essential reading for students and historians of the region."&#x2014;Ghada Karmi, author of <i>Married to Another Man: Israel's Dilemma in Palestine</i><br><br>"Salt makes it abundantly clear that when it comes to the Middle East, 'the West' talks idealistically and acts brutally.

Following the upheaval of the Davidic monarchy, the temple&#x2019;s destruction, the disenfranchisement of the Jerusalem priesthood, the deportation of Judeans to other lands, the struggles of Judeans who remained in the land, and the limited returns of some Judean groups from exile, the covenant motif proved to be an increasingly influential symbol in Judean intellectual life. The contributors to this volume, drawn from many different countries including Canada, Germany, Israel, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States, document how Judean writers working within historiographic, Levitical, prophetic, priestly, and sapiential circles creatively reworked older notions of covenant to invent a new way of understanding this idea. These writers examine how new conceptions of the covenant made between YHWH and Israel at Mt. Sinai play a significant role in the process of early Jewish identity formation. Others focus on how transformations in the Abrahamic, Davidic, and Priestly covenants responded to cultural changes within Judean society, both in the homeland and in the diaspora. Cumulatively, the studies of biblical writings, from Genesis to Chronicles, demonstrate how Jewish literature in this period developed a striking diversity of ideas related to covenantal themes.</p></p><p>&#x201c;R.

Disappointed by the lack of interest shown by Dutch investors in his efforts to raise a loan for the United States, Adams changed his tactics, and in a memorial made a forthright appeal to the States General of the Netherlands for immediate recognition of the United States. Published in Dutch, English, and French, it offered all of Europe a radical vision of the ordinary citizen&#x2019;s role in determining political events. In this volume, for the first time, the circumstances and reasoning behind Adams&#x2019;s bold moves in the spring of 1781 are presented in full.</p><p>In July the French court summoned Adams, the only American in Europe empowered to negotiate an Anglo&#x2013;American peace, to Paris for consultations regarding an offer made by Austria and Russia to mediate the Anglo&#x2013;French war. In his correspondence with France&#x2019;s foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Adams passionately insisted that the United States was fully and unambiguously independent and sovereign and must be recognized as such by Great Britain before any negotiations took place. This volume shows John Adams to be a determined and resourceful diplomat, unafraid to go beyond the bounds of traditional diplomacy to implement his vision of American foreign policy.</p></p><p>Gregg L. Lint is Series Editor of the Papers of John Adams at the Massachusetts Historical Society.&#x201c;The heart of the matter, quite simply, is John Adams&#x2015;fussing, fuming, stretching his mind to its widest effort, using his eyes to detect everything visible and supposable about the human comedy and tragedy of which he is an event-making part.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adrienne Koch</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;These volumes [11 and 12] are elegantly produced and contain many helpful features...

When the Saudis attacked the hitherto obscure Houthi militia, which they believed had Iranian backing, to oust Yemen's government in 2015, they expected an easy victory.

Henderson, one of the first generation of Jungian analysts, and Dyane N. Sherwood, a practising analyst, this book is a striking and unique contribution to the resurgence of interest in alchemy for its way of representing the phenomenology of creative experience. <br><br><em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> is organized around 22 illuminated paintings from the early Renaissance alchemical manuscript the <em>Splendor Solis</em>, and is further illustrated by over 50 colour figures. The images of the <em>Splendor Solis</em> are possibly the most beautiful and evocative alchemical paintings to be found anywhere, and they are widely known to students of alchemy. Jung reproduced several <em>Splendor Solis</em> images in his works, yet prior to this book no one has explored the symbolism of the paintings as a series in relation to the process of depth psychological transformation. This book is the first scholarly study of the paintings in their entirety, and of the mythological and historical allusions contained within the images. <em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> does not simply explain or analyze the pictures, but invites the reader to participate in the creative and transforming process evoked by these images.<br><br><em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> is a truly unique book that will be of immense value and interest to analysts and psychotherapists, as well as scholars of mediaeval and renaissance intellectual history and students of spiritual disciplines.</p><p><strong>Joseph L.

It focuses on tools for professionals in the law enforcement, intelligence, and military communities. It must be understood that the Muslim Brotherhood in America prepares the ground for, supports, and facilitates jihadi operations. Once the information provided in this handbook is understood, it necessarily gives security and intelligence professionals a factual basis to address the enemy, changes what constitutes reasonable suspicion/probable cause, and transforms how this threat is approached and addressed. As this Handbook makes clear, the Muslim Brotherhood has operatives in our federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, our military, but, most importantly, advising our senior leadership in our national security apparatus. This problem is much more a counterintelligence and espionage problem than it is a counterterrorism problem. Once the control the Muslim Brotherhood has within the U.S. government&#x2019;s decision-making process is understood, it becomes clear America faces an insurgency inside our homeland, which requires a very different response, especially from local law enforcement. In a counterinsurgency, the focus of the main effort is at the local level. Local police, working together with their local council, are the first line of defense against this enemy. But first you must have an educated and energized local populous. It is our hope you will read and study what is contained herein. The information has been broken down in a usable form without losing the real depth of thought and effort by our adversary. This is an enemy who is cunning, patient, well-supported and well-organized.

With poems that span from the beginnings of Modernism to present day, <i>The Star By My Head: Eight Swedish Poets</i> is an essential bilingual volume that offers stark, exquisite translations by internationally acclaimed poets and translators Malena M�rling and Jonas Ellerstr�m.

The result of thorough research using sophisticated computer programs to search for new terminology and ensure that all the latest vocabulary from Latin American Spanish and American English is covered, this brand new edition covers over 24 varieties of Spanish as it is written and spoken throughout the Spanish-speaking world-from Spain to Mexico, from Peru to the River Plate.<br> This groundbreaking edition of the <em>Oxford Spanish Dictionary</em> features 20,000 new entries (10,000 in each language), with the updating focused particularly on business, IT, and scientific terminology. Special entries on life and culture explain the differences between institutions, administrative systems, educational systems, and general life in the Spanish and English-speaking worlds, offering vital background to the language. Also, for a limited time only, all <em>OSD</em>'s will be packaged with a free CD that contains cutting-edge text-to-speech software. This software enables users to type in any word, phrase, question, or date, and an audio version of the text will immediately pronounce it with appropriate inflection. No other Spanish dictionary offers this revolutionary software.<br> With a newly designed user-friendly format, the dictionary is more accessible than ever. Each entry is in color making it easy for the reader to distinguish between and search for words. With half of the entries in English and half in Spanish (including the front matter), the <em>Oxford Spanish</em> <em>Dictionary</em> is the ideal reference for native speakers of either language. Handy, easy-to-use, and wide-ranging, this dictionary is also the essential tool for all students and teachers, as well as translators and language professionals. Jacket covers are also available in Spanish.</p><p><br>Beatriz Galimberti Jarman, Roy Russell, Carol Styles Carvajal, and Jane Horwood are expert bilingual lexicographers who have led a team of Spanish, Latin American, British, and American editors throughout this project.<br>Grade 7 Up--When the Oxford University Press produced the expanded second edition of its Spanish dictionary in 2001, it was broadened to include 275,000 words and phrases and contained 450,000 translations. The hefty tome covered both European and Mexican Spanish. This edition expands the second by 25,000 words (about half on each side of the dictionary) and 50,000 translations. To catch contemporary words and usages, a combination of Web-based technology and vetting by native speakers was employed, resulting in the addition of technological and business vocabulary, as well as slang and buzz words. Covering all 24 varieties of regional Spanish, the dictionary also sports a new layout, with words in blue and definitions in a clean, though small, black type. Cultural notes as well as boxes containing information on grammar and usage--such as phrasal verb forms--extend the coverage of the work. [...] Collections with the second edition of the Oxford or with other unabridged dictionaries such as the Collins Spanish-English, English-Spanish Dictionary (HarperCollins, 1997) may not need to add the third Oxford. However, given the comprehensive coverage, it is worth consideration for most libraries.--Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Michael C. Rea argues that divine hiddenness is not a problem to be explained away but rather a consequence of the nature of God himself. He shows that it rests on unwarranted assumptions and expectations about God's love for human beings. Rea explains how scripture and tradition bear testimony not only to God's love, but to God's transcendence. He shows that God's transcendence should be understood as implying that all of God's intrinsic attributes--divine love included--elude our grasp in significant ways.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael C.

Symbolic Economies makes available for the first time in English generous selections from Goux's Freud, Marx: Economie et symbolique (1973) and Les iconoclastes (1978). Goux brings the theories of historical materialism and of psychoanalysis into play to illuminate and enrich each other, and undertakes a compelling integration of the contributions of structuralism and post-structuralism. Looking closely at the work of such major figures as Lacan, Derrida, and Nietzsche, Goux extends the implications of Marxism and Freudianism to an interdisciplinary semiotics of value and proposes a radical concept of exchange. Literary theorists, philosophers, social scientists, cultural historians, and feminist critics alike will welcome this important and provocative work.</p></p><p></p><h2>The St. Martin&#39;s Guide to Writing</h2><p>The best-selling college rhetoric for over 20 years, <i>The St. Martin's Guide</i> has an unparalleled record of proven success.

Though the regime&#x2019;s contributions to the planet&#x2019;s four-fold food-fuel-finance and climate crises are well documented, the solutions&#x201d; advanced by our national and global institutions reinforce the same destructive technological path, the same global market fundamentalism, and the same unregulated consolidation of corporate power in the food system that brought us the crisis in the first place.<br> <br> A dynamic global food movement has risen up in the face of this sustained corporate assault on our food systems. Around the world, local food justice activists have taken back pieces of the food system through local gardening, organic farming, community-supported agriculture, farmers markets, and locally-owned processing and retail operations. Food sovereignty advocates have organized locally and internationally for land reform, the end of destructive free trade agreements, and support for family farmers, women and peasants. Protests against and viable alternatives to the expansion of GMOs, agrofuels, land grabs and the oligopolistic control of our food, are growing everywhere every day, giving the impression that food movements are literally breaking through the asphalt&#x201d; of a reified corporate food regime.<br> <br> The social and political convergence of the practitioners&#x201d; and advocates&#x201d; in these food movements is also well underway, as evidenced by the growing trend in local-regional food policy councils in the US, coalitions for food sovereignty spreading across Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe, and the increasing attention to practical-political solutions to the food crisis appearing in academic literature and the popular media. The global food movement springs from strong commitments to food justice, food democracy and food sovereignty on the part of thousands of farmers unions, consumer groups, faith-based, civil society and community organizations across the urban-rural and north-south divides of our food systems. This magnificent movement of movements&#x201d; is widespread, highly diverse, refreshingly creative and politically amorphous.<br> <br> <b>Food Movements Unite! </b>is a collection of essays by food movement leaders from around the world that all seek to answer the perennial political question: What is to be done?<br> <br> The answers from the multiple perspectives of community food security activists, peasants and family farm leaders, labor activists, and leading food systems analysts will lay out convergent strategies for the fair, sustainable, and democratic transformation of our food systems. Authors will address the corporate food regime head on, arguing persuasively not only for specific changes to the way our food is produced, processed, distributed and consumed, but specifying how these changes may come about, politically.</p><p><b>Samir Amin</b> is director of the Third World Forum in Dakar, Senegal.

Coleridge, Wordsworth's sister Dorothy, and the two Hutchinson sisters Sara and Mary formed a close-knit group whose members saw or wrote to one another constantly. Coleridge, whose marriage was collapsing, was in love with Sara, and Wordsworth was about to be married to Mary, who would be moving in beside Dorothy in their Grasmere cottage. Throughout this extraordinary period both poets worked on some of their finest and most familiar poems, Coleridge's Dejection: An Ode and Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. In this fascinating book, John Worthen recreates the group's intertwined lives and the effect they had on one another. </p><p>Drawing on the group's surviving letters, and poems, as well as Dorothy's diaries, Worthen throws new light on many old problems. He examines the prehistory of the events of 1802, the dynamics of the group between March and July, the summer of 1802, when Wordsworth and Dorothy visited Calais to see his ex-mistress and his daughter Caroline, and the wedding between Wordsworth and Mary in October of that year. In an epilogue he looks forward to the ways in which relationships changed during 1803, concentrating on a single day&#x2014;11 January 1803&#x2014;in the lives of the group.</p></p><p>British academic John Worthen gives a new spin to the oft-told tale of English Romanticism's best-known coterie. It's well known that William Wordsworth married Mary Hutchinson, that Samuel Taylor Coleridge hopelessly loved her sister Sara, and that Dorothy Wordsworth served as intimate friend to them all, not least her brother William. Worthen deepens our knowledge by closely analyzing every available document--diaries, letters, household accounts--from a pivotal six-month period in 1802 when Coleridge wrote "Dejection: An Ode" and Wordsworth began work on one of his most famous poems, "Ode: Intimations of Immortality." Only by delving into the artists' daily lives, Worthen asserts in a thoughtful preface, can we truly understand the way their creativity fed off the natural world and their personal relationships. Taking critical issue with previous biographers (particularly Richard Holmes), whom he argues used source material very selectively to serve their own agendas, Worthen seeks a fairer, fuller view. He reminds us that the Wordsworths' highly unconventional lifestyle shocked many people other than Coleridge's soon-to-be-estranged wife, Sarah (better treated here than in many books on the period). He asserts that there is no documentation to suggest that Sara Hutchinson regarded Coleridge's declaration of adulterous love with anything but shock and horror, again reproving scholars who overread the evidence. Most crucially, Worthen makes clear the key importance of the interchange among Coleridge and the Wordsworth siblings, which shaped both men's poetry and placed Dorothy at the group's emotional center. The academic (though accessible) prose and dense lines of argument may intimidate casual readers, but this excellent study turns literary monuments back into human beings. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>John Worthen is professor of D.

Lawrence Studies at the University of Nottingham.</p><h2>Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality (Maresfield Library)</h2><p><p>This book expands the symbols of the phallus and vagina into cosmic symbols, not by reference to myths but by his interpretations of embryonic, physiological, psychological facts.&nbsp;It develops the view that the whole of life is determined by a tendency to return to the womb, equating the process of birth with the phylogenetic transition of animal life from water to land, and linking coitus to the idea of "thalassal regression": "the longing for the sea-life from which man emerged to primeval times".</p></p><p>Sandor Ferenczi (7 July 1873 - 22 May 1933) was a Hungarian psychoanalyst, a key theorist of the psychoanalytic school and a close associate of Sigmund Freud whod latter wrote that Ferenczi made &#34;all analysts his students&#34;, a fitting tribute to a towering figure of psychoanalysis. In 1910, at Freud&#39;s suggestion, Ferenczi proposed the founding of the International Psychoanalytic Association, and in 1913 founded the Hungarian Psychoanalytic Society. In 1916 he underwent a brief personal analysis with Freud, and in 1918 was elected president of the International Psychoanalytic Society. Ferenczi&#39;s early contributions to psychoanalysis have been so fully assimilated that their origin is often forgotten, although his later writings, which were more speculative and deviated from Freudian orthodoxy, have been less widely accepted. He is acknowledged to have been a gifted therapist. He proposed a number of innovations in technique including at first these centered on the so-called &#34;active&#34; technique, while his later study of reactions of disappointment and mistrust that the child suffers in his relationship with his parents inspired a few of his pupils, notably Alice Balint (1949), to investigate early parent-child relationships.</p><h2>The Psychology of Prejudice (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>This comprehensive, research-based text examines the major theories of prejudice and stereotyping through an engaging narrative that reads like a well-crafted story rather than an empty series of statistics.</b> </p> <p>Though the focus of this book is on empirical studies, author Todd D. Nelson has synthesized the data and presented it in a way that will excite readers. His goals were two-fold: To create a strong central text (as opposed to a simple collection of readings) for professors teaching a course in prejudice, and also to facilitate student interest in the subject. <i>The Psychology of Prejudice</i> is intended to stimulate critical thinking about what causes, maintains, and reduces prejudice and stereotyping, while also relaying the historical background on the birth of research on stereotypes.</p></p><p><b>The Psychology of Prejudice,</b> Todd D. Nelson&#x2019;s newly revised and updated text, offers students an in-depth look at the roots of prejudice based on empirical literature and current research. Nelson pairs comprehensive coverage of the material with an approachable and conversational writing style, making the text accessible for students. With its applied focus, <b>The Psychology of Prejudice</b> challenges readers to think critically and formulate personal opinions about issues such as ageism, sexism, and racism. The improved pedagogical features of the second edition of the text, including summary sections at the conclusion of each chapter, will only improve students&#x2019; understanding of this important discipline. <p> <b>New Features of the 2nd Edition:</b> </p><ul> <li>New sections on sexist humor and the neurobiology of prejudice </li><li>Expanded coverage of research on homosexuals, the overweight, and the physically-challenged </li><li>Updated section on implicit stereotyping and prejudice</li> </ul> <p> I think this is a very good text on prejudice well-written, entertaining, stimulating, and informative. <br> <i>Gretchen Sechrist, The State University of New York at Buffalo</i> </p><p> The text is written in a manner that is both interesting and empirically-based.

Edited by Michael Sadleir and Frederick Page.</p><p>Trollope was born in 1815, the product of a formidable mother and a tragically unsuccessful father who was socially ambitious for his sons. Poor, ill-dressed, awkward, and sullen, he was the victim of vicious bullying at Harrow and Winchester. But he had inherited his mother&#39;s determination, and managed later to carve out a successful career in the General Post Office while devoting every spare moment to writing. In this book, Trollope looks back on his life with some satisfaction.Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) started his writing career while working in Ireland as a postal surveyor. Travelling around the country, Trollope gained knowledge of the country and its people which proved to be useful material for his first two novels, The Macdermots of Ballycloran (1847) and The Kellys and the O&#39;Kellys (1848). Trollope soon started writing fiercely, producing a series entitled Chronicles of Barsetshire. The Warden, the first in the series, was published in 1855. Barchester Towers (1857), the comic masterpiece, Doctor Thorne (1858), Framley Parsonage (1861), The Small House at Allington (1864) and The Last Chronicle of Barset (1867) followed, portraying events in an imaginary English county of Barsetshire. In 1867, Trollope left the Post Office to run as a candidate for the Parliament. Having lost at the elections, Trollope focused on his writing. A satire from his later writing, The Way We Live Now (1875) is often viewed as Trollope&#39;s major work, however, his popularity and writing reputation diminished at the later stage of his life. Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882.</p><h2>Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice (2nd Edition)</h2><p>Comprehensive in approach, this introduction to network and internetwork security provides a tutorial survey of network security technology, discusses the standards that are being developed for security in an internetworking environment, and explores the practical issues involved in developing security applications.</p><p><p> As we enter the age of universal electronic connectivity in which viruses, hackers, electronic eavesdropping, and electronic fraud can threaten the prosperity and productivity of corporations and individuals, security is increasingly important.

How to reconcile Robert Crumb&#39;s cult-status comic offenses with Mike Kelley&#39;s taboo, childish handiwork and Jim Nutt&#39;s measured, dogged portraits? How to link Peter Saul&#39;s violent, colorful caricatures with H.C. Westermann&#39;s eccentric folk fancies? Though none belong firmly to the artistic mainstream, each of these artistic mavericks has exerted a strong influence on their contemporaries and on generations of younger artists--infecting their eyes, if you will, with a shared visual language influenced by comic books, advertisements, folk art, and daily life. Often run through with explicit sexuality and violence, and always visually bombastic, the works presented in Eye Infection are not for the faint-hearted or soft-eyed but for the pop-culture aficionado, the surreptitious comics reader, the humorist, the eccentric, and, of course, the follower of contemporary art.</p><p>Rudi Fuchs is the Director of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. <br> Robert Storr is the Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. He has published monographs on Philip Guston, Robert Ryman and Raymond Pettibon, and has been a contributing editor at "Art in America" since 1981. He is also the author of "Gerhard Richter: October 18, 1977".Eye Infection is a fitting title for this exhibition catalog featuring the work of five artists who have lurked on the edge (and in some cases beyond the edge) of the mainstream art world. The works are irritating, grotesque, often offensive, and in every case very disturbing. Nevertheless, essayist Robert Storr (senior curator of painting and sculpture, Museum of Modern Art, New York) and curator Braun (Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam) do an admirable job of convincing us that these artists have a place in American art history. Grouped together for both their distinctiveness and their refusal to play by the "rules" of contemporary art, these five artists (Robert Crumb, Mike Kelley, Jim Nutt, Peter Saul, and H.C. Westermann) use their own visual language to shock, irritate, and assault the viewer, yet this exhibition is a testament to the fact that their "outsider" art is being reassessed and placed within the larger picture of American art. The catalog accompanies an exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and includes a chronology and bibliography for each artist. Recommended for libraries with strong contemporary arts collections (and strong stomachs).

In this concise, well-written work, a noted philosopher and committed evangelical enables thoughtful readers to grapple with key questions in the relationship between faith and historical understanding and leads them to the awareness of a necessity for commitment to the One who stands behind as well as in history. ? Richard V. Pierard, Professor of History, Indiana State UniversityHighly recommended. ? Calvin Theological Journal<br>Professor Nash has given us a lucid exposition of an important subject that should concern both Christian and serious inquirers into the basis of Christianity. He has the gift of making very profound philosophical issues comprehensible to the average reader. His use of quotations and illustrations is most illuminating. I appreciated especially his clear analysis of the existential and naturalistic presuppositions of a key New Testament scholar, Rudolf Bultmann. I will be glad to recommend this volume to undergraduates, graduates, and faculty colleagues. ?

The 14th Edition of Introduction to Logic, written by Copi, Cohen &amp; McMahon, is dedicated to the many thousands of students and their teachers - at hundreds of universities in the United States and around the world - who have used its fundamental methods and techniques of correct reasoning in their everyday lives.</p><p>Copi and Cohen&#39;s Introduction to Logic, Ninth Edition, is by far the most complete treatment of introductory logic, both deductive and inductive, both classical and modern. It is the standard text in logic today--the paradigm of clarity and accuracy. This text enables all students to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic. Lively argumentative excerpts from politics, philosophy, science, and contemporary controversies bring substance and life to the study of logic--demonstrating the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems. Arguments excerpted as illustrations and as exercise material include examples of fallacies to show students how arguments go wrong when logical principles are ignored or misapplied. A few examples of argumentative reasoning were constructed for the book to demonstrate principles; however, it is the wealth of current, up-to-date examples selected from actual texts representing many fields of interest that set this book apart.<p> Many changes will be found in this new edition of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> but instructors who have used previous editions may be assured that the integrity and spirit of this book have been retained. Much of the detail of previous editions and most of the exercises also have been retained. The changes introduced&#x2014;of five different kinds&#x2014;are designed to make this well-tested volume more accessible, and thus more effective as an instrument in the teaching of elementary logic. We recount these changes briefly here, addressing this report mainly to those acquainted with previous editions. </p> <p><b><i>A Revised Chapter 1.</i></b></p> <p> Structural changes have been made in the first part of the book. The expansion of the opening chapters in the preceding edition was found by many users to hinder student progress along what may be called "the main line" of instruction in logic. We have therefore compressed the material of what was Part One into a single opening chapter in which the same topics are addressed, but more crisply, and in ways likely to provide a better base for the more advanced material in the later chapters of the book. Chapter 1 has now become very hefty as a result&#x2014;but it is also richer, more clearly formulated, and more fun to read. </p> <p><b><i>Exposition-Rules and Definitions.</i></b></p> <p> The most pervasive of the changes in this edition, and most important too, we think, are the very many adjustments in the ways in which theoretical matters are explained and expressed. We have long prided ourselves on the logical accuracy of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> and of course we would do nothing to injure our hard-earned reputation for reliability. But our colleagues around the country have advised us, on many occasions, that our efforts to be exact, and to cut no corners, have in some parts of the book resulted in formulations rather difficult to digest&#x2014;especially for beginning students. </p> <p> This is not an easy matter to address. We have worked hard to ameliorate this problem&#x2014;and if we have succeeded in this edition many of the resultant changes will be hardly noticeable. Explanations should be formulated in language that is transparent and thoroughly perspicuous, and (we hope) that will cause few brows to wrinkle. </p> <p> Some illustrations of the kind of changes we have made are worth noting. Several of our colleagues observed that, where a set of rules or criteria have been put forward (as, for example, those to test the validity of categorical syllogisms, or to appraise the merit of analogical arguments), our exposition relied too heavily, in referring to a rule, upon the number assigned to it rather than to the substance of the rule itself. We have reformulated such exposition, consistently referring now to the rule itself. </p> <p> Another example of reformulation will be noted in the chapter on definition. Previously, in explaining methods of defining, we caused needless confusion by using that much misunderstood word "connotation." The terms "connotation" and "denotation" were not employed erroneously, but to avoid confusion, we now rely fully upon the terms "intension" and "extension" in explaining techniques of definition. </p> <p> Even format can serve to confuse, or to clarify. It was and remains our practice, in presenting deductive exercises in symbols, to mark the conclusion of an argument with the three triangular dots (.-.) that commonly represent "therefore." But in earlier editions we had sometimes placed this sign on the same line as the last premise of the argument, after a slash; and sometimes we had placed this sign on a separate line of its own. This proved to be a source of distraction if not confusion, so we now consistently place the three-dot "therefore" sign of conclusion on a separate line. This format enables students to see more sharply the claim that the argument is making, and what the target of a needed proof must be. </p> <p> Many such adjustments appear in this edition, far too many to permit their identification in this Preface. In some cases the change is no more than the clarification of a transition, in others the tightening of a paragraph in which the prose was blurred. A textbook in logic ought to be concise, but it must also be precise; precision and clarity we have prized above all. </p> <p> Along with such adjustments we have sought, where feasible, to strike a lighter and more friendly tone in this edition, to introduce illustrations or observations that may amuse as they instruct. The study of logic is sometimes laborious, but it need not be forbidding. </p> <p><b><i>Sidebars.</i></b></p> <p> Those who study logic with the help of this book differ very greatly in the range of their interests and in the degree of their preparation. We will not be satisfied if we fail to challenge those who are most well prepared and most acute; but those coming to systematic logic for the first time also deserve support and guidance appropriate for them. To this end, we have introduced a device that is wholly new to <i>Introduction to Logic:</i> We have sought to distinguish some portions in some chapters that may, for good reasons, be omitted in some learning contexts, or may be treated by instructors as tangential to "the main line." These portions can serve to challenge some students who feel ready for additional work. </p> <p> Finding a way to do this without injury to the whole is problematic. We have adopted the simple device of a sidebar. These sidebars take two forms, "Advanced Material" and "For Enrichment." We emphasize that this contrivance is not meant to depreciate the passages so marked off, which are often especially interesting and demanding. But such sidebar material, we hope, will make it easier for instructors to guide their own students to a mastery of the elements of theory most critical for them&#x2014;and perhaps to avoid some complexities not essential for their solid grasp of elementary logic. Many instructors will simply ignore these markings, and may do so without damage to the understanding of their students. </p> <p><b><i>Technical Changes.</i></b></p> <p> Some technical changes have been introduced into this edition of <i>Introduction to Logic</i>&#x2014;changes that we think reduce ambiguity and thus support instruction. </p> <p> For example, we have responded to the frequently expressed concern of colleagues by expanding the discussion of logical equivalence in Chapter 8, now more sharply emphasizing the differences between material equivalence as a truth-functional connective, and logical equivalence as a logical relation that justifies the rules of replacement. An entirely new section on this topic (section 8.6) has been inserted, and in this section we have introduced a new symbol for logical equivalence as well. </p> <p> In earlier editions we allowed the equivalences expressed by the rules of replacement&#x2014;the last 10 of the 19 Rules of Inference&#x2014;to be symbolized by the same three-bar symbol with which material equivalence ("if and only if") is symbolized throughout. This practice had some justification, but it surely led to student confusion when, for example, rules of replacement were formulated in which the three-bar symbol appeared more than once, with more than one meaning. A distinct symbol was needed. </p> <p> Selecting that symbol has been a matter of long-continuing deliberation. Many alternatives were considered and rejected for reasons pedagogical or theoretical or aesthetic. We have chosen to retain the three-bar symbol, <i>over</i> which a small T indicates that the equivalence confronted is a tautology. This achieves the teaching aim, we think, with a minimum of disruption. Students are rarely called upon to write the symbol for logical equivalence&#x2014;but can (with this notation) recognize it unambiguously when it appears in the list of he rules of replacement that natural deduction employs. </p> <p> Elsewhere in the treatment of deduction, we have changed the design of Venn diagrams in representing Categorical Syllogisms. Where previously we had used simple shading to mark off what the premises of the argument rule out, we have in this edition used slanted lines. This permits the impact of each of the two premises of a syllogism to be distinguished, and because their lines are slanted in opposite directions, a cross-hatching results when the logical impacts of the two premises overlap. Different colors we chose not to use, not wanting to convey the suggestion that students would need anything more than an ordinary pencil to employ Venn diagrams for themselves. </p> <p><b><i>Revised Exercises.</i></b></p> <p> Finally, exercise sets provided at the close of many sections have been enriched. Many exercises have been added, some removed. As in previous editions of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> we have sought to provide a wide array of illustrative passages, where possible on controversial issues likely to be of genuine interest to college students. Some contrived exercises are still used, or course, but we take pride in the fact that the exercises are for the most part extracted from worthy books and periodicals of very great variety. We have not excluded the writing of classical, and even ancient philosophers&#x2014;but we greatly favor arguments and illustrations produced in the push and pull of discourse in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. </p> <p> As in the past, we have scrupulously avoided partisanship in selecting these materials. When some passage provides a telling example of some mistake in reasoning, or a fine illustration of some argumentative technique, we have included it whatever our judgment of its conclusion might be. What we wrote in the Preface to the preceding edition we again affirm: The argumentative chips must be allowed to fall where they may. </p> <p> Finally, we draw attention to the substantial influence of criticisms and suggestions received from colleagues, senior and junior&#x2014;whose names and institutions are noted elsewhere in these pages. We strive to make <i>Introduction to Logic</i> a teaching instrument ever more finely tuned, and the responses of readers around the world have given us splendid help in spotting errors and identifying deficiencies. We earnestly welcome this thoughtful engagement-and for this continuing and widespread support we express here, not for the first or the last time, our heartfelt appreciation. </p></p><h2>The Essential Guide to Freelance Writing: How to Write, Work, and Thrive on Your Own Terms</h2><p><p>Prime Your Freelance Writing Career for Success!</p><p>So you want to be a freelance writer.

Paralleling similar movements in art and music, their intensely personal poetry leans more heavily on oblique suggestions and evocation than on overt statement. It sets its perceptions, intuitive and nonrational, squarely against intellectual and scientific thinking&#x2015;and this with a music that is flexible, intrepid, and subtle, sometimes even dissonant and jazzy. But the poetry itself is the movement's best definition. <br><br>Here with bilingual text en face, an introduction, and illuminating notes, are some forty carefully selected poems of that movement. They range from the remote beginnings in Nerval and Baudelaire, through the humor and irony of Corbi�re and Laforgue, to the technical brilliance of Val�ry, who died as recently as 1945. For those who wish an overall view of the movement, this is a generous sampling.</p><p><b>C.F.

Salamanca, Spain. Frustrated at their first advance, British forces under Wellington&#x2019;s command have spent the last four days maneuvering and retreating from the French army. Patient and cautious, Wellington is determined not to make a fatal mistake. He glimpses a moment of opportunity and grasps it, committing all of his troops to a sudden devastating attack. At the end of the day, the French army is broken, panic-stricken, and reeling; Wellington has achieved the finest victory of his brilliant military career.<br><br>This book examines in unprecedented detail the battle of Salamanca, a critical British victory that proved crushing to French pride and morale in the Peninsular War (1808-1814). Focusing on the day of the battle, award-winning author Rory Muir conveys the experience of ordinary soldiers on both sides, dissects each phase of the fighting, and explores the crucial decisions each commander made. Muir employs wide-ranging British and French sourcesmany unpublished or obscureto reconstruct every aspect of the battle. Having walked the battlefield itself, a site which remains today much as it was in 1812, he relates the ebb and flow of the battle with particular vividness. Muir also discusses in separate commentary sections his sources of information and explains how he has dealt with the inevitable contradictions and gaps in evidence that emerged during his research. Complete with maps, battleground plans, and other illustrations, this compelling book focuses long overdue attention on a single day in Salamanca that changed European history.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Rory Muir is visiting research fellow in the department of history, University of Adelaide.

In this groundbreaking work, cognitive psychologist David C. Rubin offers for the first time an accessible, comprehensive examination of what such traditions can tell us about the complex inner workings of human memory. Focusing in particular on their three major forms of organization--theme, imagery, and sound pattern--Rubin proposes a model of recall, and uses it to uncover the mechanisms of memory that underlie genres such as counting-out rhymes, ballads, and epics. The book concludes with an engaging discussion of how conversions from oral to written communication modes can predict how cutting-edge computer technologies will affect the conventions of future transmissions. Throughout, Rubin presents the results of important original research as well as new perspectives on classical subjects. Splendidly written and farsighted, <em>Memory in Oral Traditions</em> will be eagerly read by students and researchers in areas as diverse as cognitive psychology, literary studies, classics, and cultural anthropology.</p><p>David C. Rubin is at Duke University.<br>"Rubin writes clearly and has organized a mass of material, presenting it both minutely and conceptually. Cognitive psychologists and those who work in relevant specialized areas will find the book of interest..." -- <em>A Journal of Reviews and Commentary in Mental Health</em><p></p><br>"This is a challenging, interdisciplinary book that promises to have a ripple effect far beyond its home discipline of cognitive psychology....It has enormous implications for the more than one hundred oral traditions that have received specialist treatment over the past few decades, as well as for literary studies, folklore, and anthropology more generally. Dr. Rubin has brought cognitive psychology into a wholly unprecedented dialogue with studies in oral tradition. The result is a truly new perspective on memory and the processes of oral tradition that reinterprets the work of Milman Perry, Albert Lord, and others in an extremely productive way. Not only does Rubin make the psychological view understandable for the layperson, but he manages to reprise the Parry-Lord research in just as clear and up-to-date a manner." --John Miles Foley, William H. Byler Distinguished Professor of English and Classical Studies, University of Missouri<p></p><br>"This is a great book. Not just 'important' or 'fascinating' but great; a very Parthenon of a book."--Roger Brown, John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Filled with fascinating and important insights about how memory really works in the field....This work dramatically enhanced my understanding of 'knowledge in the world'." --Donald A. Norman, Apple Computer, Inc., and University of California, San Diego (Emeritus)<p></p><br>"The beauty of interdisciplinary scholarship is the possibility of novel contributions that enrich both fields. Rubin's merger of cognitive psychology and oral history clarifies and advances knowledge in both areas. . .stands on its own while inviting continued examination of other oral transmissions such as humor and urban legends." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Creative Journal for Children A Guide for Parents, Teachers and Counselors</h2><p>The seventy-two exercises for journal keeping in this book are simple and enjoyable ways for children from kindergarten through junior high to: express feelings and thoughts, feel comfortable about writing and drawing, acquire the habits of self-observation and reflection, foster a positive self-image, exercise imagination, learn to communicate, strengthen attention span and concentration, enrich academic skills, and find strength and wisdom within. <br><br>The Creative Journal Method is a tested technique that can be used easily at home or in the classroom.

Heeding it is about deliberately choosing a way of life and work consistent with individual gifts, passions, and values. Through powerful stories and a guided exploration of 52 possible callings, Whistle While You Work helps readers discover how to make a living doing what they were born to do. The authors provide a framework for embracing a very abstract subject in a systematic, practical, and fun way. And their Calling Cards &#34;&#34;TM&#34;&#34; help readers develop answers to profound life questions as they learn to &#34;&#34;listen with the third ear&#34;&#34; to cultivate a mode of searching that isn&#39;t limited to the merely tangible.</p><p>In <i>Whistle While You Work</i>, Richard Leider and David Shapiro counter the clich�d query about what you want to be when you grow up with a more intriguing question: "What is your life's calling?" The authors define calling as "the inner urge to give our gifts away in service to something we are passionate about in an environment that is consistent with our values." Drawing upon psychologist James Hillman's metaphor of the acorn programmed to grow into an oak tree, Leider and Shapiro guide readers to discover their "core gifts" and the work they were born to do. Each chapter describes a conversation with a cabdriver in a different city to introduce a key idea about the process of heeding your life's calling. These lively conversations are followed by stories of individuals--from a Motorola executive to a building security guard--who have identified their calling. The stories are paired with bulls-eye exercises that allow readers to discover their calling. Tools include "calling cards" to identify core gifts, a "calling journal" and the "calendar/checkbook" exercise to align values with time management.<p> The book would have been strengthened with more narrative about the relationship between choosing a calling and maintaining a positive cash flow. Yet the clarity and conviction of its approach sets this book apart from other do-what-you-love career books. It is an eloquent and practical blueprint for being at home in the world by making a living with your uniqueness. --<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p>EVERYONE WANTS to live a life that enables them to make the most of their unique gifts, interests, and passions-to find their true calling, the work they were born to do. Whistle While You Work is a liberating guide that uses powerful stories and exercises to help readers find truly satisfying, fulfilling work consistent with their deepest values. <p>The authors combine a thoughtful and practical discussion about calling with examples showing how to apply these ideas to one's life. They mix in dozens of inspiring stories featuring individuals who have found-or are in the process of finding-their calling with straightforward advice and suggestions on how to discover one's calling. Most importantly, they provides readers with a solid path for embracing calling-a subject usually addressed abstractly-in a useful, fun, and systematic way. </p><p>Through a unique Calling Card(tm) exercise that features a guided exploration of 52 "natural preferences"-such as Advancing Ideas, Doing the Numbers, Building Relationships, Performing Events-the book gives readers a new way to detect and reflect on the core of their life's work. By using this and other tools in the book, readers develop their own answers to three critical questions: What gift do I naturally give to others? What gift do I most enjoy giving to others? What gift have I most often given to others? In answering those questions, they will reveal to themselves their calling-and ultimately move toward new realms of success and fulfillment. </p><p>Whistle While You Work is an inspiring, effective, and entertaining approach to discovering one's calling. It will equip all of us with the mind-set, stories, coaching, and, perhaps most importantly, the hope we need to find our way ahead-and see a clear picture of what our right work is and what to do with our limited time here on Earth.</p></p><h2>Minecraft Modding with Forge: A Family-Friendly Guide to Building Fun Mods in Java</h2><p><p>Playing Minecraft is a lot of fun, but the game is more engaging, entertaining, and educational when kids learn how to build mods&#x2014;small programs that let them modify game elements and add content.

The Serenity Prayer states:</p><p><em>Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>The courage to change the things I can,<br>And the wisdom to know the difference.</em></p><p>Exploring the prayer phrase by phrase, Morris shows the hope that can be found by gaining a deeper spiritual understanding of its words and by practicing its message. Enlightening and profound, <em>The Way of Serenity</em> includes moving narratives, illuminating historical anecdotes, and pertinent biblical passages that demonstrate the power of the Serenity Prayer to help us grow closer to God and find greater peace and happiness.</p></p><p><p>Father Jonathan Morris, Fox News religion analyst, bestselling author, and parish priest, has seen firsthand how easily our day-to-day lives are consumed with anxiety and stress as we focus on our failures and troubles, while peace feels unattainable. When he re-discovered the Serenity Prayer, he realized that this little prayer can be, in fact, a powerful roadmap for our spiritual journey toward God. As he began to share this prayer with others, he saw that living these simple lines became a source of profound peace and happiness:</p><p><em>Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>The courage to change the things I can,<br>And the wisdom to know the difference.</em></p><p>For years a mainstay of recovery programs, this prayer has proven it can change lives. What's more, through it we all can find comfort and support, including an active collaboration with God's grace as he works alongside us to grant the serenity we seek. Unpacking the prayer phrase by phrase, Father Jonathan shows how we can gain a deeper spiritual understanding by practicing its message. Through powerful personal stories, illuminating historical anecdotes, and biblical passages that show us God's plan for our lives, <em>The Way of Serenity</em> will help us grow closer to God and find serenity, regardless of our circumstances.</p><p>Join Father Jonathan and the many others who have made this prayer an integral part of their lives, and find lasting peace and happiness today.</p><p>Father Jonathan Morris is a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of New York and serves in campus ministry at Columbia University.

Time is an intricate part of our experience&#x2015;it would seem that the passage of time is a prerequisite for having any experience at all&#x2015;and yet recalcitrant questions about time remain. Is time real? Does time flow? Do past and future moments exist? Philosophers face similarly stubborn questions about identity, particularly about the persistence of identical entities through change. Indeed, questions about the metaphysics of persistence take on many of the complexities inherent in philosophical considerations of time. This volume of original essays brings together these two essentially related concepts in a way not reflected in the available literature, making it required reading for philosophers working in metaphysics and students interested in these topics. </p><p>The contributors, distinguished authors and rising scholars, first consider the nature of time and then turn to the relation of identity, focusing on the metaphysical connections between the two, with a special emphasis on personal identity. The volume concludes with essays on the metaphysics of death, issues in which time and identity play a significant role. This groundbreaking collection offers both cutting-edge epistemological analysis and historical perspectives on contemporary topics.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Harriet Baber, Lynne Rudder Baker, Ben Bradley, John W.

In a narrow medical sense, Down Syndrome is a common disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. It is named after John Langdon Down, the British asylum medical superintendent who described the syndrome as 'Mongolism' in a series of lectures in 1866. In 1959, the disorder was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by the French paediatrician and geneticist J�r�me Lejeune and has since been known as Down Syndrome (in the English-speaking world) or Trisomy 21 (in many European countries). But children and adults born with this chromosomal abnormality have an important collective history beyond their evident importance to the history of medical science.<br><br>David Wright, a Professor in the History of Medicine at McMaster University, looks at the care and treatment of individuals with Down Syndrome&nbsp;- described for much of history as 'idiots', - from Medieval Europe to the present day.

This brisk narrative fills a significant gap in the literature on recent U.S. history, making use of diverse memoir material, journalistic accounts, biographies, and specialized policy studies, including those produced recently. <br> Rather than focusing solely on the Reagan and Bush administrations or presidencies, <em>Right Turn</em> addresses the various policy, cultural, social, economic, and technological issues that made the 1980s and early 1990s such an interesting product of the events that proceeded it--and such a vital force in American life that followed. Beginning in the late 1970s and concluding in the early 1990s, this book examines how conservative ideas and organizations reemerged from the shadows of the Great Depression and the New Deal. It describes national politics and public policies implemented by conservative Republicans, the dramatic climax of the Cold War, and the ways in which economic, legal, social, and cultural developments affected ordinary Americans in all their diversity. Featuring numerous photographs throughout and detailed guides to specialized readings at the end of each chapter, <em>Right Turn</em> is ideal for history and political science courses that cover post-1945 America as well as the 1980s and 1990s.<br></p><p>Michael Schaller is at University of Arizona.</p><h2>Buzz: The Stimulating History of the Sex Toy</h2><p><p><strong>In the vein of Mary Roach's <em>Bonk,</em> a&nbsp;brilliant microhistory of the sex toy that ultimately tells the story of our changing sexual mores and evolving cultural values.&nbsp;</strong></p> Once only whispered about in clandestine corners, vibrators have become just another accessory for the suburban soccer mom. But how did these once-taboo toys become so socially acceptable? The journey of the devices to the cultural mainstream is a surprisingly stimulating one.<br><br> In <em>Buzz</em>, Hallie Lieberman provides a riveting history that tells the story of sex toys from ancient phalluses to 21st century vibrating rabbits. She focuses on the period from the 1950s through the present, when sex toys evolved from symbols of female emancipation to tools in the fight against HIV/AIDS to consumerist marital aids and finally to mainstays of today's pop culture. Lieberman's history is populated by vivid and fascinating characters, including Ted Marche, an entrepreneurial ventriloquist and dildo maker; Duane Coleglazier, the gay ice cream truck driver who founded the first boutique sex-toy store; Dell Williams, ex-communist advertising maven who created the feminist sex toy store; Betty Dodson, whose workshops helped 1960s women discover vibrators; and Gosnell Duncan, a paraplegic engineer who invented the silicone dildo. And these personal dramas are all set against a backdrop of changing American attitudes toward sexuality, feminism, LGBTQ issues, and more.<br><br> Both educational and titillating, <em>Buzz</em> will make readers think quite differently about those secret items hiding in bedside drawers across the nation. <p>&nbsp;</p> 16 pages of color images</p><p>Hallie Lieberman obtained her PhD from the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison in 2014, with a dissertation on Sex Toy History.

A unified view of stability theory for ODEs and PDEs is presented, and the interplay between ODE and PDE analysis is stressed. The text emphasizes standard classical methods, but several newer approaches also are introduced and are described in the context of simple motivating examples. Exercises and student projects are available on the book&#39;s webpage, along with Matlab mfiles for implementing methods. Readers will gain an understanding of the essential ideas that underlie the development, analysis, and practical use of finite difference methods as well as the key concepts of stability theory, their relation to one another, and their practical implications.

For those who believe that the policies of the Chinese Communist Party pose a threat to free and open societies, the U.S. and like-minded nations must band together to preserve a rules-based international order. For others, this approach spells disaster; it ignores the history and dynamics propelling China&#x2019;s rise to superpower status. Rather than threatening the post-war order, China is its best, and maybe only, guarantor in an era of declining U.S. leadership, increased regional instability, and slowing global growth.</p><p>The twenty-fourth semi-annual Munk Debate, held on May 9, 2019, pits former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs H.

This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Patricia Ingham. When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the North of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In North and South Gaskell skilfully fused individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale created one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature. In her introduction Patricia Ingham examines Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s treatment of geographical, economic and class differences, and the male and female roles portrayed in the novel. This edition also includes further reading, notes and a useful glossary. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-65) was born in London, but grew up in the north of England in the village of Knutsford. In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell and had four daughters, and one son who died in infancy. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848, winning the attention of Charles Dickens, and most of her later work was published in his journals, including Cranford (1853), serialised in Dickens&#39;s Household Words. She was also a lifelong friend of Charlotte Bront�, whose biography she wrote.

Informed by their Jewish identity and experiences of being outsiders, these thinkers produced one of the most brilliant and effervescent intellectual movements of modernity. </p><p>Political philosopher Seyla Benhabib&#x2019;s starting point is that these thinkers faced migration, statelessness, and exile because of their Jewish origins, even if they did not take positions on specifically Jewish issues personally. The sense of belonging and not belonging, of being &#x201c;eternally half-other,&#x201d; led them to confront essential questions: What does it mean for the individual to be an equal citizen and to wish to retain one&#x2019;s ethnic, cultural, and religious differences, or perhaps even to rid oneself of these differences altogether in modernity? Benhabib isolates four themes in their works: dilemmas of belonging and difference; exile, political voice, and loyalty; legality and legitimacy; and pluralism and the problem of judgment.</p><p>Surveying the work of influential intellectuals, <i>Exile, Statelessness, and Migration</i> recovers the valuable plurality of their Jewish voices and develops their universal insights in the face of the crises of this new century.</p></p><p><p>Seyla Benhabib is the Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Yale University. Her many books have been translated into more than fourteen languages, and include Dignity in Adversity, The Rights of Others, and The Claims of Culture (Princeton).</p>&#x201c;Examining key aspects of German-Jewish thought in the twentieth century, this incisive and lucid book traces affinities and difference in the lives and work of intellectuals confronting the pressures of exile, statelessness, and migration.

This skillful rendering by John Gardner of seven Middle English poems into sparklingly modern verse translation&#x2014;most of them for the first time&#x2014;represents a selection of poems that, generally, have real artistic value but are so difficult to read in the original that they are not as well known as they deserve to be. The seven poems are: <i>The Alliterative Morte Arthure</i>, <i>Winner and Waster</i>, <i>The Parlia�ment of the Three Ages</i>,<i> Summer Sunday</i>,<i> The Debate of Body and Soul</i>,<i> The Thrush and the Nightingale</i>,<i> </i>and <i>The Owl and the Nightingale.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The first four poems represent high points in the alliterative renais�sance of the fourteenth century. <i>Morte Arthure</i>,<i> </i>here translated for the first time in its entirety into modern verse, is the only heroic romance in Middle English&#x2014;a work roughly in the same genre as the French <i>Song of Roland. </i>The other three poems have been included in the anthology as further poetic examples.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>With his employment of extensive comments and notes on the poems, Gardner provides a wealth of aids to appreciation and understanding of his outstanding translations.

What accounts for the success of free trade against then prevailing mercantilist doctrines? And how well has free trade withstood various theoretical attacks that have challenged it since Adam Smith's time? In this readable intellectual history, Douglas Irwin explains how the idea of free trade has endured against the tide of the abundant criticisms that have been leveled against it from the ancient world and Adam Smith's day to the present. An accessible, nontechnical look at one of the most important concepts in the field of economics, <i>Against the Tide</i> will allow the reader to put the ever new guises of protectionist thinking into the context of the past and discover why the idea of free trade has so successfully prevailed over time.</p><br><p> Irwin traces the origins of the free trade doctrine from premercantilist times up to Adam Smith and the classical economists. In lucid and careful terms he shows how Smith's compelling arguments in favor of free trade overthrew mercantilist views that domestic industries should be protected from import competition. Once a presumption about the economic benefits of free trade was established, various objections to free trade arose in the form of major arguments for protectionism, such as those relating to the terms of trade, infant industries, increasing returns, wage distortions, income distribution, unemployment, and strategic trade policy. Discussing the contentious historical controversies surrounding each of these arguments, Irwin reveals the serious analytical and practical weaknesses of each, and in the process shows why free trade remains among the most durable and robust propositions that economics has to offer for the conduct of economic policy.</p></p><p>The topic of "free trade" is more dense and complex than is usually presented in political debate or in the slogans or bumper stickers that these days often suffice for political discourse. Douglas A. Irwin, a professor of business at the University of Chicago, helps add depth to the discussion with this sweeping study of the business of trade between nations. He begins with Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and carries through to some of history's greatest thinkers on the topic of free trade. He shows "how free trade came to occupy ... a commanding position in economics and how free trade has maintained its intellectual strength ... over the past two centuries." It is a timely and needed book.<p>"This is a useful and valuable book that brings together a wide range of historical arguments for and against free trade. It may keep many an analyst of trade policy from the need to reinvent the wheel."<b>--Jerry Z. Muller, Catholic University of America</b></p></p><h2>I Ching (Classics of Ancient China)</h2><p>For more than two thousand years, the oracular, enigmatic pronouncements of the I Ching (Classic of Changes) have intrigued and inspired readers. In the West, scholars have long regarded the volume as one of the seminal texts of Chinese culture, comparable to the Bible or the Upanishads, and readers everywhere have turned to the hexagrams, line statements, and commentaries for guidance on every imaginable life situation.<br>Given the enduring importance of this work, it was a momentous event when a significantly different I Ching text was unearthed in Mawangdui, China, in 1973--the first new manuscript of the work to appear in two thousand years. Now translated into English for the first time by one of West's leading scholars of the I Ching, the Mawangdui text brings welcome clarity, accessibility, and novelty to this beloved classic.<br>Like the received version, the Mawangdui I Ching and its commentaries begin with a central core of sixty-four hexagrams, but in an important departure, the hexagrams in the newly discovered text are arranged in a systematic and logical way and, in many cases, are assigned different names. The line statements that accompany the hexagrams frequently differ from the received text. In addition, the Mawangdui version contains five new commentaries that had been lost for more than two thousand years, including the surprising discovery of a commentary that quotes Confucius extensively on how he had come to change his earlier, negative, views about the importance of the I Ching.<br>The new material, the logical arrangement of the hexagrams, the more Taoist tone of the "Appended Judgments", the illuminating introduction and notes by Edward L. Shaughnessy and, above all, the lucid purity of his translation, make the Mawangdui I Ching a treasure. Readers who wish to use the hexagrams for divination will find this version more intriguing than even the previous text; scholars will derive new insights from the Mawangdui commentaries and from the "Appended Judgments," one of the most sophisticated and subtle essays in all of Chinese philosophy; admirers of world literature will cherish this volume as a work of timeless artistry.</p><p>What are the most widely read and commented upon works in history? The Bible? The Vedas? The Quran? How about the <i>I Ching</i>? Every major thinker in Chinese history has had something to say about it. Passed down from generation to generation, it has been admired, studied, and put into practice. In 1973, archaeologists unearthed a number of silk manuscripts dating back to 168 B.C. Included in the find was a version of the <i>I Ching</i> and four commentaries previously lost. The text itself differed in places from the accepted version, especially in the arrangement of the hexagrams. Scholar Edward Shaughnessy has translated the entire text, along with the four commentaries and an additional commentary (the Appended Statements) that traditionally accompanies the text. The newly discovered commentaries offer a variety of interesting opinions, one of which appears to be Taoist, while another has Confucius explaining what the <i>I Ching</i> means to him. Shaughnessy includes the Chinese text of both the received version and the excavated version, although, unfortunately, the notes are buried in the back, making it difficult to follow the subtle differences. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Diary of a Christian Soldier: Rufus Kinsley and the Civil War</h2><p>Rufus Kinsley was a farmer from rural Vermont who became an officer in one of the nation&#39;s first and most famous black regiments during the Civil War. Diary of a Christian Soldier offers a meticulous reconstruction of Kinsley&#39;s life and an annotated transcription of his hitherto unpublished wartime diary, which sheds light on a long neglected theater of the war-the battle for the bayou country of southwestern Louisiana-and illuminates the workaday routines of black and white soldiers stationed behind Union lines. Kinsley&#39;s diary reveals that he was a dedicated evangelical abolitionist soldier who believed that the war and its consequences were divine retribution for the sin of slavery and that he believed that the Civil War was not actually about saving the Union, but about freeing slaves. David Rankin&#39;s biography places Kinsley&#39;s Civil War experience in the context of his life and times. David C. Rankin, who has received fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies and the Charles Warren Center at Harvard University, has written extensively on slavery, the South, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. His articles have appeared in the Journal of Southern History, Perspectives in American History, and other publications; he is also the editor of My Passage at the New Orleans &#34;Tribune&#34;: A Memoir of the Civil War Era (Louisiana State University, 2001).</p><p>This book is a biography of Rufus Kinsley, a volunteer soldier from rural Vermont, and an annotated transcription of Kinsley&#39;s previously unpublished Civil War diary. The diary is important because it illuminates the transition of an ordinary farmer into a Civil War soldier, because it reveals the typical day-today life of one of the nation&#39;s most famous black Civil War regiments, and because it offers the unique perspective of a common soldier with religious and radical views that allowed him to see that the Civil War was not really about saving the union but about freeing the slaves."Rankin has written a meticulous introductory biography...superb editorial work. [The work] more than succeeds as a jeremiad, replete with biblical prophecies and scriptural notations from a dedicated abolitionist and champion of the temperance movement... Recommended for New England and Civil War collections as well as large libraries." <br> - Library Journal<br><br>"Diary of a Christian Soldier: Rufus Kinsley and the Civil War provides a vivid firsthand account of the Union struggle for control of the Louisiana bayous and of life among the African American soldiers who served there." <br> - The Journal of Southern History, James H. Moorhead, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"Rufus Kinsley's diary offers an insight into a region not often covered in Civil War writing, the experiences of slaves becoming freedmen and the inner world of being an officer in a Civil War regiment.

Quartered with his regiment in a Cossack village, Olenin revels in the glories of nature and the rough strength of the Cossacks and Chechens. Smitten by his unrequited love for a local girl, Maryanka, Olenin has a profound but ultimately short-lived spiritual awakening. Try as he might to assimilate, he remains an awkward outsider and his long search for a more enlightened and purposeful existence comes to naught.<br>With the philosophical insight that would characterize Tolstoy&#x2019;s later masterpieces, this long overdue major new translation is a revelation.</p><p>This novel of love, adventure, and male rivalry on the frontiers of nineteenth-century Russia -- completed in 1862, when Tolstoy was in his early thirties -- has always surprised readers who know Tolstoy best through the vast, panoramic fictions of his middle years. Unlike those works, The Cossacks is lean and supple, economical in design and execution.PETER CONSTANTINE was awarded the 1998 PEN Translation Prize for <i>Six Early Stories</i>, by Thomas Mann, and the 1999 National Translation Award for <i>The Undiscovered Chekhov</i>. Widely acclaimed for his recent translation of the complete works of Isaac Babel, he also translated Gogol&#x2019;s <i>Taras Bulba</i> for the Modern Library.

What's actually going on in our brains when we make these judgments? Through original research, customer loyalty expert Chris Malone and top social psychologist Susan Fiske discovered that our perceptions arise from spontaneous judgments on warmth and competence, the same two factors that also determine our impressions of people. We see companies and brands the same way we automatically perceive, judge, and behave toward one another.

We use those same powers of detection to draw conclusions about the people we buy products and services from, even if we never have direct contact with them. We infer a great deal about the intentions of our cable companies and smartphone makers from the experience we have with their products and services, as well as all the information about them we are exposed to. As a result, whether we realize it or not, we are not actually loyal to companies or brands, but rather we are loyal to what we believe we know about the people behind them. </p> <p><b>How did you two first meet and come to work together? </b></p> <p>I (Chris) first stumbled upon Susan's work through an article in <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, which led me to discover Susan's extensive academic research on warmth and competence. I contacted Susan with an email that started with, "I've become a fan of your work," and proposed that we test whether her human perception model was predictive of how customers relate to companies and brands. It's been a wonderful and enlightening journey together ever since.</p> <p><b>What do you mean by warmth and competence? </b></p> <p>Leading researchers and social psychologists have shown that we judge others almost instantly along two dimensions: What are the intentions of other people toward me? And how capable are they of carrying out those intentions? In the academic world, these two categories of social perception are known as warmth and competence, respectively, and they drive most of our emotions and behavior toward other people. </p> <p>Through our research over the past three years, Susan and I have discovered that customers engage with and become loyal to companies and brands in the same way they do with other people&#x2014;on the basis of their warmth and competence. </p> <p><b>Which companies and brands did you find are successfully building lasting relationships with their customers? Which ones are failing?</b></p> <p>There are many companies and brands, large and small, that use technology to build and maintain one-to-one relationships with customers. Some examples from our book include Zappos, Domino's, and Mercedes, as well as Dr. Kelly Faddis, Zane's Cycles, and Honest Tea. What these companies have in common is that they put the best interests of their customers ahead of their own short-term financial interests. </p> <p>On the other hand, companies that focus heavily on maximizing shareholder value in the short term end up doing themselves more harm than good in the process. Despite their other successes, large companies like Toyota, Sprint, and Goldman Sachs have learned this lesson the hard way and are still recovering from their missteps. Perhaps not surprisingly, banks, oil companies, airlines, and telecom firms dominate the list of most disliked companies. What these have in common is a reputation for profiting at their customers' expense.</p><p>People everywhere describe their relationships with brands of all kinds in deeply personal ways&#x2014;we hate our banks, love our smartphones, and think the cable company is out to get us.

And how capable are they of carrying out those intentions? Social psychologists call these two categories of perception warmth and competence, and they drive most of our emotions and behavior toward other people&#x2014;and in today's modern world, toward businesses too.

This spellbinding book answers these questions by tracing the history of Soviet nuclear policy from developments in physics in the 1920s to the testing of the hydrogen bomb and the emergence of nuclear deterrence in the mid-1950s.<br><br>In engrossing detail, David Holloway tells how Stalin launched a crash atomic program only after the Americans bombed Hiroshima and showed that the bomb could be built; how the information handed over to the Soviets by Klaus Fuchs helped in the creation of their first bomb; how the scientific intelligentsia, which included such men as Andrei Sakharov, interacted with the police apparatus headed by the suspicious and menacing Lavrentii Beria; what steps Stalin took to counter U.S. atomic diplomacy; how the nuclear project saved Soviet physics and enabled it to survive as an island of intellectual autonomy in a totalitarian society; and what happened when, after Stalin's death, Soviet scientists argued that a nuclear war might extinguish all life on earth. <br><br>This magisterial history throws light on Soviet policy at the height of the Cold War, illuminates a central but hitherto secret element of the Stalinist system, and puts into perspective the tragic legacy of this program today&#x2015;environmental damage, a vast network of institutes and factories, and a huge stockpile of unwanted weapons.</p><p><b>David Holloway </b>is professor of political science and co-director, Center for International Security and Arms Control, at Stanford University. He is also the author of <i>The Soviet Union and the Arms Race</i>, published by Yale University Press. <br>Tracing the development of nuclear power in Stalinist Russia, Holloway examines such topics as the role of espionage and the relationships between scientists and politicians. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Survival Guide to the Misinformation Age: Scientific Habits of Mind</h2><p>We live in the Information Age, with billions of bytes of data just two swipes away.

Bypassing the oft-told tales of radicals and revolutionaries on either coast, Beth Bailey argues that the revolution was forged in towns and cities alike, as "ordinary" people struggled over the boundaries of public and private sexual behavior in postwar America. </p><p>Bailey fundamentally challenges contemporary perceptions of the revolution as simply a triumph of free love and gay lib. Rather, she explores the long-term and mainstream changes in American society, beginning in the economic and social dislocations of World War II and the explosion of mass media and communication, which aided and abetted the sexual upheaval of the 1960s. Focusing on Lawrence, Kansas, we discover the intricacies and depth of a transformation that was nurtured at the grass roots. </p><p>Americans used the concept of revolution to make sense of social and sexual changes as they lived through them. Everything from the birth control pill and counterculture to Civil Rights, was conflated into "the revolution," an accessible but deceptive simplification, too easy to both glorify and vilify. Bailey untangles the radically different origins, intentions, and outcomes of these events to help us understand their roles and meanings for sex in contemporary America. She argues that the sexual revolution challenged and partially overturned a system of sexual controls based on oppression, inequality, and exploitation, and created new models of sex and gender relations that have shaped our society in powerful and positive ways.</p></p><p>Beth Bailey is Foundation Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Kansas.[A] vivid reminder of just how national and chaotic the events we call &#x2018;the sixties&#x2019; really were... <b>Bailey</b>&#x2019;s exploration of the sexual revolution offers a subtler sense of the underlying forces of that era, which unified even while dividing a nation and, ultimately, the world. (Tom Engelhardt <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>[<b>Beth Bailey</b>&#x2019;s] applied research here is interesting, imaginative and compassionate, and the final treat is that Bailey is a very good writer. <i>Sex in the Heartland</i> is simply a fascinating read. I&#x2019;m sorry I can&#x2019;t call her up and congratulate her on this book in person... [This book is] beautifully shaped, carefully thought out, a treasury of useful information. (Carolyn See <i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>One of the great strengths of this book is <b>Bailey</b>&#x2019;s ability to make local characters, institutions and fights vital and compelling, all the while keeping an eye on the broader issues at stake. She gives us a vivid portrait of one university town in transition and a case study for U.S. social history. A cast of local characters comes alive... Virtually every chapter has surprising, subtle turns in which Bailey&#x2019;s thesis of historical paradox and unintended consequences is amply demonstrated. (Maureen McLane <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>The book&#x2019;s greatest strength is its delineation of &#x2018;social and cultural changes&#x2019; as effected by watershed events (panty raids, the advent of the Pill, birth control clinics, co-ed dorms, coffee houses, and underground newspapers); [and] local and national institutions (which provided moral direction and financial and social support). (Jay A. Gertzman <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br><b>Bailey</b>&#x2019;s account of the sexual revolution in Lawrence, Kansas is a rejoinder to American critics on the right who continue to see this process as something imposed on ordinary people by bohemian intellectuals and sex radicals located on either coast, and not as a phenomenon integral to America&#x2019;s &#x2018;heartland.&#x2019; In Bailey&#x2019;s account, the sexual revolution was a grassroots movement happening in any number of college towns across the USA, and created unwittingly by &#x2018;people who had absolutely no intention of abetting a revolution in sex.&#x2019; Bailey argues that the replacement of moral with therapeutic frameworks for understanding sexual and emotional problems undermined any remaining moral consensus by offering non-punitive judgments on homosexuality and other forms of deviance. Unnoticed developments like the reform of parietals were far more important, in Bailey&#x2019;s reading, than the pill or the counter culture... The fact that Bailey&#x2019;s attention is directed towards the less renowned, everyday sources of sexual revolution makes this a valuable book. (H. G. Cocks <i>Journal of Contemporary History</i>)<br><br>Published by the prestigious Harvard University Press, the book suggests that out-of-the-mainstream states such as Kansas actually were on the cutting edge of the nation&#x2019;s sexual revolution during the early 1960s. (Matt Moline <i>Capital-Journal (Topeka, KS)</i>)<br><br>[<b>Bailey</b>] points out that those who claim the radical nature of the [sexual] revolution may be surprised by just how deep-seated and mainstream the origins of many of those revolutionary changes were. (Philip Godwin, M.D. <i>Lawrence Journal-World</i>)<br><br><b>Bailey</b> examines the 20th-century &#x2018;sexual revolution&#x2019; as it played out in the midwestern college town of Lawrence, Kansas... Bailey is especially perceptive on the ambivalent and conflicted relationship of both the feminist and gay rights movements to the sexual revolution. She also has strong sections on the birth control pill and other more mundane but long-lasting changes in American sexual culture... [A] fascinating and impressive book. (K.

(Wells of Knowledge Science Series)</h2><p>What would life be like with no clocks and no calendars? How would you know when to get up in the morning? Long, long ago, all people could do was watch the sun and moon and try to figure things out. Eventually, they made simple clocks like sundials.</p><p>Robert E. Wells is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 2-4-This is a succinct, child-friendly history of how time came to be measured, from our early ancestors, who noted how the sun traveled across the sky, to the ancient Egyptians, who used "Shadow Stick clocks" to mark its path, through present-day quartz and atomic clocks. Wells discusses the Egyptians' lunar and solar calendars and the Roman calendar, and goes on to explain time zones, using meridian lines. Analogies such as "WITHOUT TIME PASSING BY, you couldn't play a computer game or eat a bowl of ice cream-" help children understand the concepts. The characters in the pen-and-acrylic illustrations look a bit like a cross between B.C. and Doonesbury comics; the hand-lettered text creates movement around the sometimes multiple images on a page, and the combination of art and words results in fun.

Reflecting the author&#x2019;s personal experiences within communist totalitarianism, this is a book about political passions, radicalism, utopian ideals, and their catastrophic consequences in the twentieth century&#x2019;s experiments in social engineering. Vladimir Tismaneanu brilliantly compares communism and fascism as competing, sometimes overlapping, and occasionally strikingly similar systems of political totalitarianism. He examines the inherent ideological appeal of these radical, revolutionary political movements, the visions of salvation and revolution they pursued, the value and types of charisma of leaders within these political movements, the place of violence within these systems, and their legacies in contemporary politics.<br><br>The author discusses thinkers who have shaped contemporary understanding of totalitarian movements&#x2015;people such as Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Isaiah Berlin, Albert Camus, Fran�ois Furet, Tony Judt, Ian Kershaw, Leszek Kolakowski, Richard Pipes, and Robert C. Tucker. As much a theoretical analysis of the practical philosophies of Marxism-Leninism and Fascism as it is a political biography of particular figures, this book deals with the incarnation of diabolically nihilistic principles of human subjugation and conditioning in the name of presumably pure and purifying goals. Ultimately, the author claims that no ideological commitment, no matter how absorbing, should ever prevail over the sanctity of human life. He comes to the conclusion that no party, movement, or leader holds the right to dictate to the followers to renounce their critical faculties and to embrace a pseudo-miraculous, a mystically self-centered, delusional vision of mandatory happiness.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Vladimir Tismaneanu combines enormous erudition, sharp insight, and unique personal experience in this wide-ranging essay on the problems of totalitarianism in the twentieth century. <i>The Devil in History </i>is mandatory reading for those interested in the crucial questions of morality and politics posed by the comparison of Nazism and Stalinism.&#x201d; &#x2015;Norman M.

There are few scholars as conversant with this material, or as able to explain it as well, as Vladimir Tismaneanu, who gives a good sense of why utopian ideals meant to overcome the ills of capitalist, bourgeois democracy went so sensationally wrong and produced such massive evil.&#x201d; &#x2015;Daniel Chirot, co-author of <i>Why Not Kill Them All? The Logic and Prevention of Mass Political Murder</i><br>"<i>The Devil in History</i> is a very important work of intellectual history that considers a basic question of the twentieth century and represents vast and ecumenical learning and well-considered personal experience. It has moments of indubitable brilliance." &#x2015;Timothy Snyder, author of <i>The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999 </i><br>&#x201c;In his revealing new study, Vladimir Tismaneanu traces the intellectual origins of the murderous twentieth century. The focus is on the ideologies of Europe&#x2019;s totalitarian regimes identified most prominently with the names Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler. Although these characters were amoral and perhaps even psychopathic killers, the author rightly insists that such labels do not explain the popular appeal of the dictators, who were worshipped as if they were gods by crowds of true believers. Even after 1945, new Communist leaders pursued quests for utopia and mounted crusades of their own, all of them doomed to fail. Tismaneanu provides a compelling and convincing account of how this monumental tragedy came to pass.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robert Gellately, author of <i>Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe</i><br><br><b>Vladimir Tismaneanu</b> is Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park, and author of several books, including <i>Stalinism for All Seasons: A History of Romanian Communism</i> (UC Press), <i>Fantasies of Salvation: Democracy, Nationalism and Myth in Post-Communist Europe,</i> and <i>Reinventing Politics: Eastern Europe from Stalin to Havel</i>.</p><h2>Student Solutions Manual for Larson/Hostetler&#39;s Elementary Algebra, 5th</h2><p>By Carolyn Neptune, Johnson County Community College, this guide includes detailed, step by step solutions to all odd-numbered exercises in the section exercise sets and in the review exercises.

In <em>Letter to a Young Farmer,</em> his final book of essays, Logsdon addresses the next generation&#x2015;young people who are moving back to the land to enjoy a better way of life as small-scale &#x201c;garden farmers.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a lifestyle that isn&#x2019;t defined by accumulating wealth or by the &#x201c;get big or get out&#x201d; agribusiness mindset. Instead, it&#x2019;s one that recognizes the beauty of nature, cherishes the land, respects our fellow creatures, and values rural traditions. It&#x2019;s one that also looks forward and embraces &#x201c;right technologies,&#x201d; including new and innovative ways of working smarter, not harder, and avoiding premature burnout.</p> <p>Completed only a few weeks before the author&#x2019;s death, <em>Letter to a Young</em> <em>Farmer</em> is a remarkable testament to the life and wisdom of one of the greatest rural philosophers and writers of our time. Gene&#x2019;s earthy wit and sometimes irreverent humor combines with his valuable perspectives on many wide-ranging subjects&#x2015;everything from how to show a ram who&#x2019;s boss to enjoying the almost churchlike calmness of a well-built livestock barn.</p> <p>Reading this book is like sitting down on the porch with a neighbor who has learned the ways of farming through years of long observation and practice. Someone, in short, who has &#x201c;seen it all&#x201d; and has much to say, and much to teach us, if we only take the time to listen and learn. And Gene Logsdon was the best kind of teacher: equal parts storyteller, idealist, and rabble-rouser. His vision of a nation filled with garden farmers, based in cities, towns, and countrysides, will resonate with many people, both young and old, who long to create a more sustainable, meaningful life for themselves and a better world for all of us.</p></p><p><p>Over the course of his long life and career as a writer, farmer, and journalist, Gene Logsdon published more than two dozen books, both practical and philosophical, on all aspects of rural life and affairs. His nonfiction works include&nbsp;<em>Gene Everlasting, A Sanctuary of Trees,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Living at Nature&#x2019;s Pace.&nbsp;</em>He wrote a popular blog,&nbsp;<em>The Contrary Farmer,</em>&nbsp;as well as an award-winning column for the Carey, Ohio,&nbsp;<em>Progressor Times</em>. Gene was also a contributor to&nbsp;<em>Farming Magazine</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Draft Horse Journal.&nbsp;</em>He lived and farmed in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where he died in 2016, a few weeks after finishing&nbsp;his final&nbsp;book,&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>&#x201c;An elegant, modern georgic in prose by &#x2018;contrary farmer&#x2019; Logsdon (<em>Gene Everlasting</em>, 2013, etc.). Of a piece with the works of Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, and other modern back-to-the-landers, Logsdon&#x2019;s last book (he died in May 2016) comprises a set of essays addressed to an imagined young person contemplating a life in the fields. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s no such thing as&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>American farmer,&#x2019; counsels the author at the outset. Instead, there are beet farmers, dairy farmers, flower farmers, marijuana farmers, and even &#x2018;moonshine farmers,&#x2019; which makes it difficult to categorize all the different kinds of farmers and to subsume them into any meaningful political organization. The point is that because there is so much diversity in farming, anyone with intelligence, gumption, and stick-to-itiveness shouldn&#x2019;t be dissuaded from having a go at it. Of course, there are plenty of reasons not to farm, and Logsdon isn&#x2019;t shy of enumerating the challenges, from the fiscal and physical ones to matters that embrace even the heart: one of his essays concerns how to find a suitable helpmeet out in the sticks, where, as a former seminarian, he discovered &#x2018;there were girls peeking out from behind every crossroads stop sign in the county.&#x2019; Times change, but the struggle continues, one aspect of it the corporatization of farming. Oddly, there Logsdon finds an ally in the chain restaurateur Bob Evans, who encouraged those who would listen to invest in biological over mechanical solutions, saying, &#x2018;tractors don&#x2019;t have babies.&#x2019; Logsdon is encouraging without being Pollyannaish, homespun while also sometimes arch: &#x2018;On the occasions when I have had to travel in city traffic, the thought always occurs to me that people who must commute into cities to work spend about as much time just waiting for traffic lights to change as it takes me to write a book.&#x2019; From raising cattle to organizing markets, there&#x2019;s much value here for every aspiring farmer, whose work requires brains along with brawn.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Foreword Reviews</em>-</strong></p> <p>"This engaging, conversational book dispenses life advice for farmers and others who seek to live close to the earth.&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer&nbsp;</em>is an accumulation of wisdom with a large dollop of humor and a conversational tone that will endear it to almost every audience. The book recalls a conversation with a parent or older family member in that many of its common-sense directives are informed by experience, from the purchasing of land to the management of aggressive rams. But not all the advice here is specific to farmers or 'garden farmers'; general life advice can be extrapolated from discussions of love, finance, and other common-sense aspects of life.&nbsp;Categorizing&nbsp;<em>Letter&nbsp;</em>is tricky at times, perhaps appropriately so, stating that 'contrary farmers,' as the author self-identifies, tend to defy stereotyping. It is philosophical, but it also dispenses concrete advice. Likewise, though it does present useful information, much of this is apocryphal, cast in a slyly humorous way, and even opinionated. For example, the author agrees that climate change is a problem, but he also describes people concerned over the issue as paranoid 'hand-wringers.&#x2019;&nbsp;<em>Letter&nbsp;</em>is best read as an inspirational piece. It seems likely to lure many a gardening neophyte to the farm life, though it takes care to stress the difficulty of this path too. Above all, it preaches consistency, locality, and the long view, occasionally contrasting this philosophy with the frantic pace of mainstream modern life. In the book&#x2019;s worldview, small farming is the key to solving the most serious of our environmental, mental, and physical problems as well as the existential emptiness of consumerism. Yet at the same time, it does not advocate complete abandonment of capitalist modality. Parts of the book recall Buddhist principles of moderation.&nbsp;With its unique point of view,&nbsp;<em>Letter to a Young Farmer&nbsp;</em>is a must-read piece of environmental, agricultural, and social philosophy.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>If Logsdon (1932-2016) had his way, the term&nbsp;<em>contrary farmer</em>&nbsp;would have been every bit as familiar as <em>country farmer</em>. A learned proponent of &#x2018;stay in and stay small' garden farming, Logsdon&#x2019;s outspoken outlook was completely in opposition to the practices and philosophies of corporate agribusiness. Instead of encouraging farmers to 'go big or get out' by adding more property, more machinery, and more debt, Logsdon championed the idea of working on a more personal scale that allows farmers to appreciate nature and honor tradition while still accepting technology and innovation. In this posthumously published book of essays, Logsdon extols the virtues of finding a good mate, praises the pluck and professionalism of women farmers, and enthuses about the health benefits of a day in the barn. Along with other hard-earned advice about hauling livestock, pasturing chickens, and controlling weeds, Logsdon&#x2019;s lifetime of farming wisdom is firmly lodged in common sense. Sagacious and sly, practical and poetic, Logsdon&#x2019;s voice may have been contrarian but it was never condescending.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In the midst of our epidemic fear of the future and its so-far predicted emergencies and catastrophes, here is Gene patiently, quietly, with the right touch of merriment, talking about the small, really possible ways of solving our one great problem: how to live on the Earth without destroying it.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Wendell Berry, from the foreword</strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong> <br> </em></p> <p>Late Ohioan farmer Logsdon (<em>Gene Everlasting: A Contrary Farmer&#x2019;s Thoughts on Living Forever</em>) sends a meaningful (though poorly titled) message to up-and-coming homestead farmers. Written during the late stages of an illness that would take the author&#x2019;s life in 2016, the book stands as his final assertion and rallying cry against the misguided notion, so prevalent at one time, that farmers needed to 'get big or get out.' The book isn&#x2019;t written in the intimate style of a personal missive as the title suggests; it&#x2019;s more of an essay collection squarely addressing topics such as small-scale economics, pasture farming, raising sheep, and the 'modern plowgirl,' with practical-minded advice throughout. This work serves as a guiding light and lodestar for farmers facing the modern challenges of any farming operation, large or small.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Emperor Charles V (Seminar Studies)</h2><p><br>Charles V was elected Holy Roman Emperor and, until his death in 1558, he was to play a central role on the European political stage.

Hoxie says that the volume "strives to introduce, to teach, and to invite further inquiry."<p>The encyclopedia contains signed entries by 260 authors and numerous unsigned entries by about two dozen other authors. There are four types of entries. First, there are descriptions of 100 tribes--the editor tried to provide coverage of all major contemporary groups. These entries are supplemented with "regional entries" that discuss smaller native communities. There are five entries on the major languages (Lakota, Navajo, Cherokee, Cree, Ojibwa) and four on the major language groups (Algonquian, Iroquoian, Pueblo, and Salishan). Secondly, there are biographies of 100 prominent deceased Native Americans. The biographees are political figures, athletes, artists, and scholars. Next, there are 100 interpretive articles on topics such as beadwork, dreams, and treaties. Finally, brief entries provide definitions of topics such as peyote, cradle boards, or the Battle of Little Big Horn. Many of the longer entries include a two-to three-item bibliography. The entry <i>Bibliographies</i> by Velma Salabiye (Navajo) gives a broad overview of scholarship in the field. Black-and-white maps and photographs (most of them historical) add interest to the text. A detailed index aids access.</p><p>The articles are well written and easy to read. There is no entry on the Lewis and Clark expedition, but the one on Sacagawea discusses it. The entry on the Blackfoot does not note that the only Indian killed during the Lewis and Clark expedition was a Blackfoot. There is no entry for trickster or New Age.</p><p>This book is similar to <i>The Native North American Almanac</i> [<i>RBB</i> My 1 94] in its popular approach, though its contributors are scholars. It is appropriate for the high-school or public library where the user needs a definition or overview.

Until now, however, there has not been a single introductory textbook that focuses specifically on this topic.</p> <p><em>Cognitive Neuroscience of Language</em> fills that gap by providing an up-to-date, wide-ranging, and pedagogically practical survey of the most important developments in the field. It guides students through all of the major areas of investigation, beginning with fundamental aspects of brain structure and function, and then proceeding to cover aphasia syndromes, the perception and production of speech, the processing of language in written and signed modalities, the meanings of words, and the formulation and comprehension of complex expressions, including grammatically inflected words, complete sentences, and entire stories.</p> <p>Drawing heavily on prominent theoretical models, the core chapters illustrate how such frameworks are supported, and sometimes challenged, by experiments employing diverse brain mapping techniques. Although much of the content is inherently challenging and intended primarily for graduate or upper-level undergraduate students, it requires no previous knowledge of either neuroscience or linguistics, defining technical terms and explaining important principles from both disciplines along the way.</p></p><p><p><strong>David Kemmerer</strong> is a professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University.

A major work of collaborative international schoarship, the Cambridge History of Latin America has been planned, co-ordinated and edited by a single editor, Dr Leslie Bethell, reader in Hispanic American and Brazilian History at University College London. It will be published in eight volumes.

This has resulted in an optimum degree of competency and high level of scholarship. The material presented and the varying interpretaions offered combine to form a highly readable text and most enjoyable experience for the reader.

Differing from the "real" poor, these clergymen, teachers, and ascetics have historically been viewed by their fellow Christians as persons who should receive material support in exchange for offering immeasurable immaterial benefits&#x2015;teaching, preaching, and prayer. Supporting them&#x2015;quite as much as supporting the real poor&#x2015;has been a way to accumulate eventual treasure in heaven. Yet from the rise of Christian monasticism in Egypt and Syria to present day, Christians have argued fiercely about whether monks should work to support themselves.</p> <p>In <i>Treasure in Heaven,</i> renowned historian Peter Brown shifts attention from Western to Eastern Christianity, introducing us to this smoldering debate that took place across the entire Middle East from the Euphrates to the Nile. Seen against the backdrop of Asia, Christianity might have opted for a Buddhist model by which holy monks lived by begging alone. Instead, the monks of Egypt upheld an alternative model that linked the monk to humanity and the monastery to society through acceptance of the common, human bond of work. This model of Third World Christianity&#x2015;a Christianity that we all too easily associate with the West&#x2015;eventually became the basis for the monasticism of western Europe, as well as for modern Western attitudes to charity and labor. In <i>Treasure in Heaven,</i> Brown shows how and why we are still living&#x2015;at times uncomfortably&#x2015;with that choice. </p><p></p></p><p><p>Peter Brown, Emeritus Professor of History at Princeton University, is the author of <i>The Ransom of the Soul: Afterlife and Wealth in Early Western Christianity</i> and <i>Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD.</i></p><p>One of the most familiar phrases in the New Testament is Jesus's exhortation to forget about earthly riches and instead store up 'treasure in heaven.' Here, Peter Brown uses the phrase to pry open ancient attitudes about the relationship between work, leisure, and piety, and the way Christianity both reflected and threatened long-standing tensions. <i>Treasure in Heaven</i> is wide-ranging, accessible, and highly readable. Someday Brown will write a book that does not stimulate new thinking. But this is not that day, nor is this that book.</p> (H. A. Drake, University of California, Santa Barbara, author of <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i>)<br><br><p>The poor were a special focus of early Christianity, but who were they? And what made them so deserving? These questions have preoccupied Peter Brown for more than a decade. After Poverty and Leadership in the Later Roman Empire and Through the Eye of a Needle, he turns here to the eastern edges of the Roman Empire and to the &#x2018;holy poor,&#x2019; those men and women who deliberately chose poverty in order to be closer to God, and who must therefore be supported by the rest of society. With his accustomed virtuosity Brown reveals hitherto unsuspected tensions between the &#x2018;real poor&#x2019; and the &#x2018;holy poor,&#x2019; and the anxious questions asked about the value of work, the impact of wealth, and the nature of the &#x2018;angelic life.&#x2019; Above all, what did &#x2018;treasure in heaven&#x2019; really mean? In the third book of his trilogy, Brown lays bare in vivid and arresting detail the legacies of Syria and Egypt, the variety and contradictions within Christianity, and the intense self-questioning of Christians in the early centuries.</p> (Dame Averil Cameron, University of Oxford)<br><br><p>Over several decades Brown has raised questions and modeled methods that have engendered flurries of scholarship in response to his suggestions. His arguments in this book depend on other scholars&#x2019; detailed studies of particular places, which he acknowledges with unusual generosity. Rather than burying authors&#x2019; names in footnotes, he lifts them into his text, praising their careful and insightful scholarship. Over the long course of his career, Brown&#x2019;s scholarship has modeled and engendered collegial scholarly conversation.</p> (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br><p>[A] welcome addition to the family of his recent publications about wealth in early Christianity.... <i>Treasure in Heaven</i> traces the trajectory towards Syrian and Eglptian monasticism in the fifth century.</p> (<i>Anglican and Episcopal History</i>)<br><br><p>Accessible though thought-provoking, <i>Treasure from Heaven</i> may profitably be read in short order by nonspecialists and specialists alike.</p> (<i>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</i>)<br><br><p>Peter Brown provides a work that thoughtfully traces complex themes of wealth and poverty. His examination illumines the multifarious nature of early Christianities, especially in Syria and Egypt, as each one contended with notions concerning labor, wealth, and the role of clergy. Furthermore, his book challenges the reader to abandon broad concepts of early Christianity and instead conceive its malleability to evolve successfully within the various landscapes of the eastern and western early Roman Empire.</p> (<i>Reading Religion</i>)</p><h2>Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment</h2><p>Paolo Sarpi (1552-1623) is remembered as the defender of Venice against the Papal Interdict of 1606 and as the first, and greatest, historian of the Counter-Reformation. The sources of his undoubted hostility to clerical authority have always been a matter of controversy; many contemporaries claimed that Sarpi was an &#39;atheist&#39;, while to others his anticlericalism suggested that he was in secret a Protestant. In the present book David Wootton argues that Sarpi&#39;s public opinions must be assessed in the light of the views expressed in his private papers. Starting from the Pensiere, in which Sarpi formulated a series of philosophical and historical arguments against Christianity, Mr Wootton seeks to reinterpret Sarpi&#39;s life work as being the expression, not of a love of intellectual liberty, nor of a commitment to Protestantism, but of a carefully thought out hostility to doctrinal religion. This interpretation of Sarpi serves to cast new light on the man and his work. But it also throws new light on the intellectual history of his age. Historians such as Lucien Febvre and R. H. Popkin have sought to deny the existence of systematic unbelief in Sarpi&#39;s day. Others, such as Christopher Hill and Carlo Ginzburg, have found evidence of a radical, popular tradition of unbelief. This book seeks, through its account of Sarpi&#39;s beliefs, to penetrate the hypocrisy which contemporaries agreed characterised the age, and to lay the foundations for a new understanding of the intellectual origins of unbelief.</p><p>In this book David Wootton assesses Sarpi&#39;s public opinions in the light of the views expressed in his private papers, reinterprets his life work as being the expression, not of a love of intellectual liberty, nor of a commitment to Protestantism, but of a carefully thought out hostility to doctrinal religion.</p><h2>Sense and Sensibility (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>In its marvelously perceptive portrayal of two young women in love, <i>Sense and Sensibility </i> is the answer to those critics and readers who believe that Jane Austen&#x2019;s novels, despite their perfection of form and tone, lack strong feeling. <br><br>Its two heroines&#x2014;so utterly unlike each other&#x2013;both undergo the most violent passions when they are separated from the men they love. What differentiates them, and gives this extroardinary book its complexity and brilliance, is the <i>way </i>each expresses her suffering: Marianne&#x2013;young, impetuous, ardent&#x2013;falls into paroxysms of grief when she is rejected by the dashing John Willoughby; while her sister, Elinor&#x2014;wiser, more sensible, more self-controlled&#x2014;masks her despair when it appears that Edward Ferrars is to marry the mean-spirited and cunning Lucy Steele. All, of course, ends happily&#x2014;but not until Elinor&#x2019;s &#x201c;sense&#x201d; and Marianne&#x2019;s &#x201c;sensibility&#x201d; have equally worked to reveal the profound emotional life that runs beneath the surface of Austen&#x2019;s immaculate and irresistible art.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

It&#39;s considered the best of Joyce&#39;s short works. It was made into a film also entitled The Dead in 1987, directed by John Huston. In 1999 it was adapted into a musical by Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey. Christopher Walken starred in the original production.</p><p><b>James Joyce</b> was born in Dublin in 1882, the oldest of ten children in a Catholic family. He attended Jesuit schools and, in 1904, moved first to Trieste, then Paris, with Nora Barnacle; they married in 1931. After publishing his first novel, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, in 1916, Joyce developed glaucoma, and his eyesight steadily diminished for the rest of his life. His seminal novel <i>Ulysses</i> was published by his friend Sylvia Beach out of her Paris bookstore, only to be banned in the US and elsewhere due to charges of indecency. Fleeing the Nazi invasion of France, Joyce died in Zurich in 1941.It would be difficult to overpraise this wonderful recording from Joyce&#39;s Dubliners. Setlock has a beautiful, subtly accented, fluid, flowing voice, a spritely voice, perfect for Joyce&#39;s spinsters and his drunks, the priests and little boys, the old politicians. Setlock does a superb job with the dialogue, with the incredible sensuality of Joyce&#39;s work, the telling detail, the moments of irretrievable loss. If one could change anything, it might be to slow him down slightly, the more to savour the words, but that would interfere with the flow and energy of Joyce&#39;s prose. E.J.M.

However, Brecht was also a hugely prolific and eclectic poet, producing <em>more than</em> 2,000 poems during his lifetime&#x2015;indeed, so many that even&nbsp;his own wife, Helene Weigel, had no idea just how many he had written. <p>"A thieving magpie of much of world literature," the full scope and variety of his poetic output did not become apparent until after his death. Now, the English-speaking world can access part of his stunning body of work in <em>Love Poems</em>, the first volume in a monumental undertaking by award-winning translators David Constantine and Tom Kuhn to translate Brecht's poetic legacy into English. <em>Love Poems</em> collects his most intimate and romantic poems, many of which were banned in German in the 1950s for their explicit eroticism.</p><p>Written between 1918 and 1955, these poems reflect an artist driven not only by the bitter and violent politics of his age but, like Goethe, by the untrammeled forces of love, romance, and erotic desire. In a 1966 <em>New Yorker</em> article, Hannah Arendt wrote of Brecht that he had "staked his life and his art as few poets have ever done." In these 78 poems, we see Brecht's astonishing and deeply personal love poems&#x2015;including 22 never before published in English&#x2015;many addressed to particular women, which show Brecht as lover and love poet, engaged in a bitter struggle to keep faith, hope, and love alive during desperate times.</p><p>Featuring a personal foreword by Barbara Brecht-Schall, his last surviving child, <em>Love Poems</em> reveals Brecht as not merely one of the most famous playwrights of the twentieth century but also one of its most fiercely creative poets.</p></p><p><p><strong>Bertolt Brecht</strong> (1898&#x2013;1956) was a German poet, playwright, and theater director. In those capacities, and also as a polemical essayist, he contributed powerfully to the chief literary and political debates of his day, and lastingly influenced theatrical theory and practice. He left more than 2,000 poems, assuring him a place among the very best lyric poets of Germany.</p><p><strong>David Constantine</strong> is a freelance writer and translator. His most recent volume of poetry is <em>Elder</em> (2014); his fourth collection of short stories, <em>Tea at the Midland</em>, won the Frank O&#x2019; Connor International Short Story Award in 2013.</p><p><strong>Tom Kuhn</strong> teaches at the University of Oxford, where he is a Fellow of St Hugh&#x2019;s College. He works on twentieth-century drama and German exile literature and has been, since 1996, editor of the main English-language Brecht edition.</p>&#x201c;Papa loved women, many women...His passion, whether expressed to women, to his art, or to his children, seemed all-encompassing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara Brecht-Schall, from the foreword</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The selection in <em>Love Poems</em> is a memorable and necessary reminder of the feeling artist in Brecht, the craftsman of humanistic, dynamic, erotic emotion... Their individualist and anarchic vibrancy do much to alter the diffuse perception of Brecht as an apparatchik with creaky polemical aims. What makes Brecht irresistible in <em>Love Poems</em> is how he ponders and prances as if some disaffected offspring of Petrarch and Catullus reared by the Earl of Rochester... [H]is best love poems match the provocations of his drama, prodding us from somatic complacency and the stultifying mundanity of our domestic lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William Giraldi, <em>New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brecht often uses his poetry to persuade, seduce; it's never sexist, just earthy and alive...The translators are to be thanked for bringing attention to these otherwise forgotten gems, both naughty and nice.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tom Lavoie, <em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A surprising cache of seventy-eight works nimbly translated by David Constantine and Tom Kuhn, with an introduction by Barbara Brecht-Schall.... They span a range of forms and formality, from tightly written sonnets to jaunty doggerel, and a marvelous scale of voices, from the filthy to the forlorn. For many, they will be a revelation.... <em>Love Poems</em> could even open the door to veneration.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eric Banks, <em>Bookforum</em></strong></p><h2>Babbitt</h2><p><br>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Babbitt is a true classic about conformity in small town America - celebrated for its comic tone, satire, and vivid dialogue. The play is based on Sinclair Lewis' novel, first published in 1922. <p> An L.A.

Babbitt, a conniving, prosperous real estate man from Zenith, Ohio, revels in his popularity, his success, and, especially, in the material rewards they bring. He bullies his wife, flirts with other women, and patronizes the less successful. But when his best friend is sent to prison for killing his wife, Babbitt&#39;s middle-class complacency is shattered, and he rebels, seeking a more &#34;meaningful&#34; life. His small revolt is quickly defeated, however, by public opinion and his own need for acceptance. Babbitt captures the flavor of America during the economic boom years of the 1920s, and its protagonist has become the symbol of middle-class mediocrity, his name an enduring part of the American lexicon.</p><h2>Ruth Crawford Seeger: A Composer&#39;s Search for American Music</h2><p>Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901-1953) is frequently considered the most significant American female composer in this century. Joining Aaron Copland and Henry Cowell as a key member of the 1920s musical avant-garde, she went on to study with modernist theorist and future husband Charles Seeger, writing her masterpiece, String Quartet 1931, not long after. But her legacy extends far beyond the cutting edge of modern music. Collaborating with poet Carl Sandburg on folk song arrangements in the twenties, and with the famous folk-song collectors John and Alan Lomax in the 1930s, she emerged as a central figure in the American folk music revival, issuing several important books of transcriptions and arrangements and pioneering the use of American folk songs in children's music education. Radicalized by the Depression, she spent much of the ensuing two decades working aggressively for social change with her husband and stepson, the folksinger Pete Seeger.<br><br>This engrossing new biography emphasizes the choices Crawford Seeger made in her roles as composer, activist, teacher, wife and mother. The first woman to win a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in music composition, Crawford Seeger nearly gave up writing music as the demands of family, politics, and the folk song movement intervened. It was only at the very end of her life, with cancer sapping her strength, that she returned to composing. Written with unique insight and compassion, this book offers the definitive treatment of a fascinating twentieth-century figure.<br></p><p><br> <strong>Judith Tick</strong> is Professor of Music at Northeastern University.<br><br>"Tick followed where Crawford's life has taken her, and has done so brilliantly....Informed by rich resources of letters, diaries, interviews, and domestic manifestos, and enriched by her grasp of the cultural tapestry against which Crawford's life took place, Tick has written an engaging narrative....With this absorbing book, readers may become familiar with a not-so-thoroughly modern composer whose life and work should now take a central place in the continuing debate over the nature of twentieth-century modernism."--<em>Women's Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Elegantly written and richly textured....Essential for all libraries."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Deriving insights from new sources and interviews and providing fresh analyses of many of Seeger's compositions, this lively but scholarly book grapples with its subject's several identities....Recommended to those seriously interested in women's studies, classical and folk music and music education, and American studies."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"This long-awaited book is more than a biography of a neglected American musician. It is an eloquent and subtle portrait of music and culture in twentieth-century America. It is a beautifully written, exemplary work of scholarship and biography."--Leon Botstein, President, <em>Bard College</em>, and Editor of <em>The Musical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"A <em>wonderful</em> book, which will be an inspiration to women musicians in many countries and languages. It will be of interest to many--not just women, and not just musicians or teachers or collectors of folk music."--Pete Seeger<p></p><br></p><h2>Applied Helping Skills: Transforming Lives</h2><p>Highly practical and student centered, <b>Applied Helping Skills: Transforming Lives</b>, is an experiential text focusing on basic skills and core interventions.

But on his way to her beautiful French chateau, Givre, where he hopes to consolidate their marriage plans, Darrow encounters Sophy Viner, who is as vibrant and spontaneous as Anna is reserved and restrained.<br>Sophy's subsequent employment as governess to Anna's daughter means that her fate becomes inextricably entwined with that of the family at Givre. And what to Darrow is a forgotten interlude becomes the reef on which the lives of four people are in danger of foundering.</p><p>Edith Wharton was at the height of her enormous literary powers when she published The Reef in 1912, and everything about this novel suggests a mastery so complete that it can achieve nothing higher. The plot, which tells of the drastic effects of a casual sexual betrayal on the lives of four Americans in France, is expertly turned, suspenseful, continually compelling. An assured, unhurried dramatic instinct governs the great moments of confrontation and revelation. The central characters, two of whom are innocents and two of whom are burdened by experience and tinged with desperation, are perfectly delineated: their relationships to one another are constructed with a classical feeling for harmony, proportion, and balance. And the entire novel is imbued with a clear-eyed wisdom about both the possibilities and the limitations of human love. Wharton would go on to write splendid books after completing The Reef, but nowhere does she display a finer command of her art than she does here.The plot of this book, which tells of the drastic effects of a casual sexual betrayal on the lives of four Americans in France, is expertly turned, suspenseful, continually compelling.

This is especially evident in the chapter on language acquisition, which now includes sections on the acquisition of morphology, syntax, and pragmatic competence. More special topics have also been added to give teachers greater freedom to shape courses to their own interests. The basic structure of the book, however, remains unchanged, with its focus on a small set of linguistic concepts that are fundamental to the field and that will allow students to get a feel for how work in different areas of linguistics is actually done. A new and expanded third edition of the companion <i>Linguistics Workbook</i> adds complementary material on universals and cross-language data.<br> <br> <i>Linguistics</i> is divided into two parts. The first part deals with the structural and interpretive aspects of language: morphology, phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, language variation, and language change. The second part is cognitively oriented and includes chapters on pragmatics, the psychology of language, language acquisition, and language and the brain. This new edition adds special topics to the chapters on morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, acquisition, and language and the brain.</p><p>The late Adrian Akmajian was Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona.<br><br>Richard A.

In this volume, fourteen theorists explore the significance for literary and cultural studies of the new paradigm of chaotics, forging connections between contemporary literature and the science of chaos. They examine how changing ideas of order and disorder enable new readings of scientific and literary texts, from Newton's Principia to Ruskin's autobiography, from Victorian serial fiction to Borges's short stories.<br> <br> N. Katherine Hayles traces shifts in meaning that chaos has undergone within the Western tradition, suggesting that the science of chaos articulates categories that cannot be assimilated into the traditional dichotomy of order and disorder. She and her contributors take the relation between order and disorder as a theme and develop its implications for understanding texts, metaphors, metafiction, audience response, and the process of interpretation itself. Their innovative and diverse work opens the interdisciplinary field of chaotics to literary inquiry.</p></p><p><strong>N. Katherine Hayles</strong> is a postmodern literary critic and the James B.

Now, for the first time since its original publication in 1942, Penguin Classics presents this exclusive edition of Steinbeck's introduction to the then-nascent U.S. Army Air Force and its bomber crew--the essential core unit behind American air power that Steinbeck described as "the greatest team in the world."<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;</p><b>By the Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature</b></p><h2>Chinese Almanacs (Images of Asia)</h2><p>Despite efforts by Chinese governments to suppress their popularity, and the influence of Western ideas and science, almanacs have been one of the most widely distributed and read publications in Chinese societies all over the world. Perhaps no other single class of artifacts reflects more clearly the essence of inherited culture and its evolution in China in late imperial and modern times. Beautifully illustrated with block-prints and full-color covers, Chinese almanacs provide a unique insight into the structure, beliefs, hopes, and concerns of Chinese societies around the world.

The papers are unified in theme by the idea that Plato's central philosophical concern in metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics was to distinguish the authentic from the fake, the original from its imitations. In approach, the collection displays Nehamas's characteristic combination of analytical rigor and sensitivity to the literary form and dramatic effect of Plato's work. Together, the papers represent Nehamas's distinct and original contributions to scholarship on Plato and Socrates and serve as a comprehensive introduction to the thought of these two philosophers.</p><br><p> In the book's opening section, Nehamas discusses Plato's representation of Socrates as a model of authentic human goodness, showing that Plato's Socrates is a more skeptical, troubling, and individualistic thinker than is usually supposed. The papers in the second section form a sustained defense of a new and important understanding of Plato's theory of the forms and the evolution of that theory in Plato's later writings. The third section examines Plato's contention that popular entertainment--by which he meant Greek epic and tragic poetry--misleads its audience into a debased life, an argument Nehamas relates to modern anxieties about television and other forms of popular culture. The collection also includes a discussion of Plato's use of the dialogue form in his representation of Socrates and carefully examines the combination of literary and philosophical elements in his work.</p><br><p> Nehamas argues in the book that Plato's specific judgments of what is authentic are often flawed, but that his idea of authenticity as the mark of truth, beauty, and goodness is stronger than many modern scholars have assumed. In drawing together Nehamas's many influential ideas about Plato and Socrates, <i>Virtues of Authenticity</i> is a major contribution to the study of ancient Greek philosophy.</p></p><p><p>"I cannot imagine that any scholar of Plato is unfamiliar with the work of Alexander Nehamas, but few will know all of these essays. It is a great boon to have them all collected and published under one cover. With the passing of his teacher, Gregory Vlastos, there is no one who combines philosophical acumen with literary sensitivity quite so well."<b>--Allan Silverman, Ohio State University</b></p><b>Alexander Nehamas</b> is Edmund N.

James C. Scott analyzes diverse failures in high-modernist, authoritarian state planning-collectivization in Russia, the building of Brasilia, compulsory ujamaa villages in Tanzania, and others-and uncovers conditions common to all such planning disasters. What these failures teach us, he argues, is that any centrally managed social plan must recognize the importance of local customs and practical knowledge if it hopes to succeed.</p><p>James C. Scott's research for this book began with an examination of the tensions between state authorities and various "unstable" individuals throughout history, from hunter-gatherer tribes to Gypsies to the homeless. He soon became fascinated, however, by the recurring patterns of failure and authoritarianism in certain social engineering programs aimed at bringing such people fully into the state's fold. Soviet collectivization, the Maoist Great Leap Forward, the precisely planned city of Brasilia--these and other projects around the world, while deeply ambitious, extracted immeasurable tolls on the people they were designed to help. <p> One of the most important common factors that Scott found in these schemes is what he refers to as a high modernist ideology. In simplest terms, it is an extremely firm belief that progress <i>can</i> and <i>will</i> make the world a better place. But "scientific" theories about the betterment of life often fail to take into account "the indispensable role of practical knowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of unpredictability" that Scott views as essential to an effective society. What high modernism lacks is <i>metis</i>, a Greek word which Scott translates as "the knowledge that can only come from practical experience." Although <i>metis</i> is closely related to the concept of "mutuality" found in the anarchist writings of, among others, Kropotkin and Bakunin, Scott is careful to emphasize that he is not advocating the abolition of the state or championing a complete reliance on natural "truth." He merely recognizes that <i>some</i> types of states can initiate programs which jeopardize the well-being of all their subjects. </p><p> Although the collapse of most socialist governments might lead one to believe that <i>Seeing Like a State</i> is old news, Scott's analysis should prove extremely useful to those considering the effects of global capitalism on local communities.</p><p><b>James C.

From the beginning of the officers&#39; careers they are trained to control their emotions, and thus are accused of being cold-hearted.

The multi-faceted, problematic history of the German lands has provoked a wide range of debates and differences of interpretation. Dr Fulbrook provides a crisp synthesis of a vast array of historical material, and explores the interrelationships between social, political and cultural factors in the light of scholarly controversies. German history is renowned for it peculiarities and paradoxes. The land of Luther, Bach and Goethe is also the land of Hitler and the Holocaust. The &#39;land in the centre of Europe&#39; played a pivotal role in the European balance of power, yet never found a satisfactory identity or even stable boundaries. For centuries, the loose framework of the &#39;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&#39;, dominated by the Austrian Habsburgs, permitted a myriad of social and political forms and cultural traditions. With late, rapid industrialisation and unification of a Prussian-dominated &#39;small&#39; Germany, domestic tensions contributed to the unleashing century, the status of a divided Germany echoed, refracted, and had implications for wider developments and divisions across the world. Only recently has the breaching of the Berlin Wall and the breathtaking rapid unification of the two germanies marked a dramatic new beginning in German history and the international order. This is the only single-volume history of Germany in English which offers a broad, general coverage of the main themes and topics. It will therefore be essential reading for all students of German, European studies and history, and will be a helpful guide to general readers, members of the business community and travellers to Germany.</p><p>Mary Fulbrook is Professor of German History, University College London.Fulbrook (University Coll., London) prefaces her concise history with the fretful expectation that "attempts to compress over a thousand years of highly complex history into a brief volume will . . . provoke squeals of protest from . . . specialists." Well, perhaps from specialists, but not from the average reader. True, the medieval centuries are dispatched summarily, but a more leisured pace leads us through the modern era to early 1990. No particular ideological stance colors the presentation, and judicious references to the various interpretations of other historians balance the account. The text is adorned nicely with 41 illustrations and 13 maps, and a "highly selective" bibliography of some 150 recent titles in English. This is a beginner's volume, a good one. The curious will need to go on for the rich detail that can make history interesting. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- James B.

Dropping names and dripping exclamation points, Stuart, the oldest person ever nominated for an Academy Award, gives herself the full diva treatment, with the help of her daughter, a cookbook and gardening author. Stuart takes us briefly through her Santa Monica (Calif.) youth and relives her days as a B-movie beauty who starred in a slew of forgettable films with titles like Laughter in Hell, along with such James Whale movies as The Invisible Man. It's not that Stuart has led a dull life; she was instrumental in organizing the Screen Actors Guild, and with her second husband, writer Arthur Sheekman, she moved in social circles that at various times included Humphrey Bogart, Dorothy Parker, Groucho Marx, and M.F.K. Fisher. But because her ego seems about as big as that doomed luxury liner, Stuart treats all of these potentially interesting subjects in a cursory manner and lavishes a great deal of attention on her own artistic impulseseverything from bonsai to painting to silk-screening. Sometimes she is unintentionally hilarious: ``Dead in the water. What to do? It was then that the art of decoupage came into my life.'' Other times, Stuart displays a childish need to shock, describing certain parts of her anatomy as a sixth-grade boy might and announcing (as though we had asked), ``I am devoted to masturbation.'' Surprisingly, apart from fawning over director James Cameron, Stuart has comparatively little to say about Titanic; she does reveal that someone once spiked the crew's clam chowder with angel dust. True to form, the author spends most of her time chronicling her return to celebrity and agonizing over whether she would receive the Oscar for her role as Old Rose. When Stuart looks back at her earlier films, she wonders, ``What had I done to deserve all this dreck?'' Those who pick up this book will likely ask themselves a similar question.

Now the world wants to know more about the obscure origins of this feisty, free-spirited octogenarian. Here, she recounts her bohemian youth in California, her disenchantment with Hollywood, and her high jinks with friends such as Groucho Marx and Humphrey Bogart. While reading, one longs for a romantic, seemingly simpler age when leisurely steamship cruises to the Orient, such as that taken by Stuart and her second husband, were not unusual among a certain set. More recent vignettes are lackluster by comparison. Stuart claims that her life has essentially been a quest to "make her mark," which culminated with Titanic.

He is the author of six other books, including Down Thunder Road, the best-selling biography of Bruce Springsteen.Muckraking, unauthorized biography of Disney that nonetheless paints such a rending picture of his childhood and young manhood that one forgives most of his later lapses. Eliot (Down Thunder Road, 1991, etc.) thinks that Disney was a great artist--which may account for what turns out to be a largely sympathetic biography of the filmmaker's dark side. Disney's fundamentalist father, Elias, was such a monster to his sons, whom he beat mercilessly, that Walt came to believe he wasn't his father's child--nor would Walt's mother protect him from Elias's savagery. These trials, and especially the anxiety about his parentage, became the template for Disney's later cartoon stories, Eliot says, and account in part for the mogul's endless troubles with his stable of animators, whom he underpaid and refused to give any power to. Nor would Disney grant Mickey Mouse's real creator, fellow animator Ub Iwerks, his proper credit, though Iwerks was Disney's oldest friend aside from the filmmaker's brother, Roy. On his marriage night, Disney found himself impotent, Eliot says, a state that later recurred during times of stress, which were exacerbated by a drinking problem and bouts of depression. Meanwhile, Disney's father had instilled in the boy a hatred of Jews, and Walt never curbed his tongue about Jews among his animators--and especially not when talking about fellow studio heads. He felt cut out of the real money in Hollywood since he could only produce movies with his own money while other studios monopolized distribution and exhibition. Following WW II, Disney helped organize resistance to the studio monopolies and in many ways brought about the downfall of the studio system. Earlier, he had become an informant for the FBI--according to Eliot, Disney wanted J. Edgar Hoover to investigate whether he really was the son of his alleged father--and, here, the author draws from some 500 pages of Disney's reports to the Bureau. Very readable, actually quite laudable, work. (Sixteen pages of photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is oriented primarily towards people who have already acquired some basic knowledge of programming and would like to deepen their understanding in a more structured way. Neveltheless, an introductory chapter is included for the benefit of the beginner, displaying in a concise form some of the fundamental concepts of computers and their programming. The text is therefore also suitable as a self-contained tutorial. The notation used is Modula-2, which lends itself well for a structured approach and leads the student to a working style that has generally become known under the title of structured programming. As a manual for programming in Modula-2, the text covers practically all facilities of that language. Part 1 covers the basic notions of the variable, expression, assignment, conditional and repetitive statement, and array data structure. Together with Palt 2 which introduces the important concept of the procedure or subroutine, it contains essentially the material commonly discussed in introductory programming courses. Part 3 concerns data types and structures and constitutes the essence of an advanced course on programming. Palt 4 introduces the notion of the module, a concept that is fundamental to the design of larger programmed systems and to programming as team work. The most commonly used utility programs for input and output are presented as examples of modules.</p><p></p><h2>Jeff Koons: One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank (Afterall Books / One Work)</h2><p><p><b>An examination of a work that captures the spirit of the 1980s&#x2015;commodification, seduction, and political inactivity.</b></p><p>In Jeff Koons's One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank (1985), a Spalding basketball floats in the center of a glass tank that stands on a four-legged black metal structure. It has been called one of the defining works of the 1980s&#x2015;but also described (by such critics as Craig Owens, Rosalind Krauss, and Hal Foster) as &#x201c;an endgame,&#x201d; &#x201c;misleading,&#x201d; and &#x201c;repulsive.&#x201d; The work presents what the artist called &#x201c;the ultimate state of being&#x201d;&#x2015;neither death nor life but the absence of change. It captured a spirit of the time, characterized by commodification, seduction, and political inactivity. Its stillness embodied the opposite of social revolution. But the &#x201c;total equilibrium&#x201d; of the work is actually temporary. For purely physical reasons, the equilibrium is lost every six months and must be reset. </p><p>In this extended essay on Koons's famous work, Michael Archer puts One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank in an art historical framework, describing its initial exhibition at International With Monument in New York and related issues of media, commercialism, and class. He discusses the wider context of the 1980s art world, in which a renewed attention to painting practices met the legacy of Pop and appropriation art&#x2015;setting the stage for the negative critical reception Koons's artwork first received. Archer goes on to consider sport as celebrity-maker and industry; the physical science of equilibrium; and the implications of the fact that the equilibrium of One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank is indeed total&#x2015;but temporary.</p></p><p>Michael Archer is an art critic and Reader in Fine Art at Goldsmiths, University of London.

At the same time, he covers the ongoing tug-of-war between themes of "respectability" versus practices derived from an African heritage; the adoption of Christianity by the majority; and the critique of the adoption of the "white man's religion" from the eighteenth century to the present. The book also covers internal cultural, gendered, and class divisions in churches that attracted congregants of widely disparate educational levels, incomes, and worship styles.<br><br>Through the Storm, Through the Night provides a lively overview of the history of African American religion, beginning with the birth of African Christianity amidst the Transatlantic slave trade, and tracing the story through its growth in America. Paul Harvey successfully uses the history of African American religion to portray the complexity and humanity of the African American experience.</p><p>Paul Harvey is professor of history at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He is the author of Redeeming the South: Religious Cultures and Racial Identities Among Southern Baptists, 1865&#x2013;1925 and Freedom's Coming: Religious Culture and the Shaping of the South from the Civil War through the Civil Rights Era.Books abound on the African American religious experience in the US, but Harvey's work is a welcome addition and succinct summary of its 400-year history. Typically in such short monographs, detail is sacrificed for brevity, but Harvey (history, Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs) packs great substance through insightful biographies and aptly summarized historical events. He argues against any uniform African American church or religious experience, as African Americans experienced varied contacts with Christianity and often mixed traditional African spiritualism and animistic beliefs. Unquestionably, religious beliefs infused the African American community with hope as they struggled through slavery, Jim Crow legislation, segregation, race-oriented violence, and the civil rights movement. Harvey concludes that though the church is still relevant and Christian denominations are still predominant in the African American community, 21st-century immigrants continue to challenge this narrative, as the Orisha traditions of West and Central Africans, Cuban Santer�a, Haitian Catholicism and Voodoo, Ethiopian Eastern Orthodoxy, and Islamic influences further heighten diversity. The author notes that clannish and local community traditions among these immigrants overshadow any presumed unity based on skin color. In summary, Harvey creates a broad panoramic of the African American religious experience and challenges future scholars to increase scholarly attention to this field. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels/libraries. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The diversity, complexity and tenacity of the African-American religious experience come alive on Harvey&#x2019;s pages....Harvey&#x2019;s inclusion of 40 pages of primary sources makes this volume even more valuable for readers interested in an extended encounter with the women and men they meet in<br>Through the Storm. (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>This deceptively slim book covers an enormous amount of historical terrain as an overview of African-American faith in America, touching a staggering number of major developments without exhaustively detailing them. Harvey, a professor of history at the University of Colorado, begins by explaining how the slave trade permanently altered religion for African-Americans, then moves on quickly to how the black church later provided cultural survival strategies. The same colonies that argued that the Bible sanctioned slavery hosted Protestant evangelical revivals where African-American Christianity was born. The book expertly pulls together the individual stories of well-known historical figures whose lives were shaped in black churches, the significance of syncretism in African and Caribbean-based religions as reflections of some elements of Christian theology, and the spread of gospel music as a new and influential part of American popular culture. There are some repetitive passages on Voodoo and Yoruba traditions, but the book is almost entirely a good, rigorous starting point for those unfamiliar with the place of African-American Christianity in America&#x2019;s history. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2011-09-01)<br><br>Harvey, a professor of history, examines the various roles that Christianity has played in the lives of African Americans. He begins at the very beginning, with Africans stolen from their homes bringing their own religious traditions, including both Christianity and Islam, with them to the Americas. The debate (and the rationalizations) among slave owners and other whites about what conversion to Christianity should mean is discussed as well the role the church played during and after the Civil War. Harvey then continues to the modern day, with an emphasis on the church&#x2019;s place in the civil rights movement. A leitmotiv that threads through the book is the importance of music in African American life and spirituality. The book ends with the dialogue between Barack Obama and his former minister Jeremiah Wright, in which Harvey finds two distinct strands of the black religious experience, 'the righteous jeremiad and the gospel of hope.' The list of primary sources that Harvey appends to the text adds value to what is a solid overview. (<i>Booklist</i> 2011-09-01)<br><br>Harvey (history, Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs) traces the development of African American Christianity from the transatlantic slave trade to the 21st-century megachurch, underscoring how the church served as a crucial institution and forum for African Americans in the United States as the country denied them a voice and equality. Not only did the church help African Americans endure and survive during slavery, but it functioned as a catalyst of the Civil Rights Movement. Harvey highlights important byproducts of the African American religious experience as well, e.g., music such as spirituals, gospel, blues, and even rap. He does not shy away from the criticism that African American Christianity has faced, e.g., for its exuberant style and preachers who have been accused of fraudulence. He covers today&#x2019;s religious pluralism, in addition to the rise of black megachurches and the 'prosperity gospel.' VERDICT Harvey&#x2019;s book is a concise and scholarly yet entirely accessible work, appropriate both for interested general readers and students. With charts, a helpful glossary, 'bibliographic essays' on primary and secondary sources, and a time line from 1491 (when the Kingdom of Kongo converted to Christianity) to Barack Obama&#x2019;s 2008 election). (<i>Library Journal</i> 2011-09-01)<br><br>Harvey provides an elegant and engaging introduction to the history of African American Christianity that charts the diversity of experience and expression among black Christians and illuminates the complex relationship between religion and race in American life. (Judith Weisenfeld, Princeton University)<br><br>If you teach, study, practice, or care about African American religion, then this is the book for you. Paul Harvey provides an indispensable overview of black Christianity from the age of slavery to the ascendance of Obama. With it, Harvey offers a bevy of fascinating primary documents that range from Nat Turner's righteous rage to Mahalia Jackson's soulful songs. <i>Through the Storm, Through the Night</i> does it all with such clarity that even the most complex concepts make sense. (Edward J. Blum, author of W. E. B. Du Bois, American Prophet)<br><br>Focuses on how Africans in America flocked to Protestant Christianity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, used their faiths to challenge slavery and then racial segregation, and in the twentieth century became more diverse with massive new immigration after 1965. Harvey is able to show both consensus and conflict.

Coming of age during the triumph of the New York School of painting, Katz synthesized its influences with wide-ranging interests shared by many of the New York School poets. Of the more than 40 paintings and aquatints gathered here, many depict that distinguished circle, as well as the iconic skyline where they changed the world. Katz is best known as a painter of people, and the wide cross-section of portraits here demonstrates the variety he brings to the genre, along with dramatic variations in scale, abrupt cropping and subtle artifices such as luxuriant backdrops that turn out to be earlier Katz paintings. Along with an essay and interview, <i>New York</i> includes an extraordinary selection of poems from friends of the artist, including some of the most important American poets of the late twentieth century, among them Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbery and Robert Creeley. Katz was born in Brooklyn in 1927 and studied at the Cooper Union and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.

Now the <em>New Historical Atlas of Religion in America</em> takes the story into the new millennium.<br> Expanded, reorganized, and now in full color, the new edition of this classic reference work is an arresting visual and narrative portrait of the growth, development, and diversity of America's communities of faith across nearly 400 years.<br> Here is a vastly more complex American religious life--from the decline of mainstream Protestantism to the emergence of evangelical churches and the growing influence of Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and other faiths. Parts One and Two are a history--in maps and text--of American religions. Part Three focuses in-depth on Lutherans, Mormons, and Roman Catholics. Part Four examines the political, cultural, and social aspects of religion in American public life.<br> Lavishly illustrated with full-color maps, charts, and diagrams, the new <em>Atlas</em> is an essential resource for all readers--students, teachers, scholars, and everyone seeking to understand the remarkable religious history of the United States.</p><p>Edwin Scott Gaustad is at University of California, Riverside. Philip L. Barlow is at Hanover College, Indiana."Anyone hoping to comprehend religion in its historical context ignores geography at some peril." So begin the editors in their preface to a new and expanded edition of the <i>Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i>, first published in 1976. The landscape of religion in America has changed much in the intervening quarter century, the growth of non-Western religious traditions and the decline of denominational loyalty among many Protestants being two examples. This revised atlas shows in maps and other illustrations where these changes have taken place over time.<p>The atlas is divided into four parts, the first two constituting the revision of the earlier edition. Part 1 covers institutional and ethnic religions to 1800, where part 2 picks up the story and continues through to the present. Each part is subdivided into sections treating Christian denominations, Judaism, Native American religions, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs, and others. The atlas clearly strives to provide a historical and comprehensive view of the pluralism of religion in America. Color maps, graphs, and other illustrations accompany brief histories of these specific religious groups. For example, the treatment of Episcopalians in part 2 includes a graph of growth and decline in church membership from 1800 to 1996 as well as maps showing the number of Episcopal churches by county in 1850, 1890, 1950, and 1990. Whenever possible, similar maps are provided for other groups, allowing for, say, a comparison of Roman Catholics and Episcopalians over the same period. Sections end with supplemental bibliographies.</p><p>Parts 3 and 4 are new to this edition. Part 3 presents case studies of three groups--Lutherans, Mormons, and Roman Catholics--in which a more detailed cartographic examination is provided. Part 4 is a less-than-successful hodgepodge of information, including a brief look at Canada, a list of religious place-names in the U.S., and the denominational composition of three recent U.S. Congresses. The "Conclusion" section of the atlas is wonderful, offering maps of denominational predominance in the U.S. by county from 1790 to 1990 as well as pie charts for each state that give 1890 and 1990 percentages of denominational affiliation. Then comes an assortment of appendixes, such as a table showing the number of churches by denomination in 1890 and maps of each state with county names. Finally, the atlas concludes with a detailed index.</p><p><i>New Historical Atlas of Religion in America</i> contains as much text as it does maps. This is a good thing, as it can easily serve as an encyclopedia of sorts of American religious history. A more thorough treatment can be found in the <i>Encyclopedia of the American Religious Experience</i> (Scribner, 1988).

The scandal created by portrayal of Christianity as an egoistic and inhumane religion cost the young Hegelian his job and, to some extent, his career. Joining philosophical argument to epigram, lyric, and satire, the work has three central arguments: first, a straightforward denial of the Christian belief in personal immortality; second, a plea for recognition of the inexhaustible quality of the only life we have; and third, a derisive assault on the posturings and hypocrisies of the professional theologians of nineteenth-century Germany.<br><br></p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Terror in the Mind of God, Fourth Edition: The Global Rise of Religious Violence (Volume 13) (Comparative Studies in Religion and Society)</h2><p>Why would anybody believe that God could sanction terrorism? Why has the rediscovery of religion&#x2019;s power in recent years manifested in such a bloody way? What, if anything, can be done about it?<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Terror in the Mind of God</i>, now in its fourth edition, answers these questions and more. Thoroughly revised and expanded, the book analyzes in detail terrorism related to almost all the world&#x2019;s major religious traditions: European Christians who oppose Muslim immigrants; American Christians who support abortion clinic bombings and militia actions; Muslims in the Middle East associated with the rise of ISIS, al Qaeda, and Hamas; Israeli Jews who support the persecution of Palestinians; India's Hindus linked to assaults on Muslims in the state of Gujarat and Sikhs identified with the assassination of Indira Gandhi; and Buddhist militants in Myanmar affiliated with anti-Muslim violence and in Japan with the nerve gas attack in Tokyo&#x2019;s subway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing from extensive personal interviews, Mark Juergensmeyer takes readers into the mindset of those who perpetrate and support violence in the name of religion. Identifying patterns within these cultures of violence, he explains why and how religion and violence are linked and how acts of religious terrorism are undertaken not only for strategic reasons but to accomplish a symbolic purpose.&nbsp;<i>Terror in the Mind of God&nbsp;</i>continues to be an indispensible resource for students of religion and modern society.</p><p>&#x201c;An unsettling book but also a courageous one. No one who truly cares about matters of faith can afford to ignore the dangers that lurk within religious extremism, and Juergensmeyer ultimately serves the highest aspirations of organized religion when he insists on shedding light on the darker corners of human belief and human conduct.&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This dark, enthralling book not only documents the global rise of religious terrorism but seeks to understand the &#x2018;odd attraction of religion and violence&#x2019; . . .

It is fascinating because of the speed at which the subject develops, the new products and the new models which we have to understand. And it is rewarding because anyone can make a fundamental breakthrough.</p> <p>"Having worked in this field for many years, I have come to appreciate the importance of getting the right balance between mathematics and intuition. Too little maths and you won't be able to make much progress, too much maths and you'll be held back by technicalities. I imagine, but expect I will never know for certain, that getting the right level of maths is like having the right equipment to climb Mount Everest; too little and you won't make the first base camp, too much and you'll collapse in a heap before the top.</p> <p>"Whenever I write about or teach this subject I also aim to get the right mix of theory and practice. Finance is not a hard science like physics, so you have to accept the limitations of the models. But nor is it a very soft science, so without those models you would be at a disadvantage compared with those better equipped. I believe this adds to the fascination of the subject.</p> <p>"This FAQs book looks at some of the most important aspects of financial engineering, and considers them from both theoretical and practical points of view. I hope that you will see that finance is just as much fun in practice as in theory, and if you are reading this book to help you with your job interviews, good luck!

What are its functions and its essential and variable elements? How do apologies differ from excuses, disclaimers, and justifications? What form does apology take in our own culture and in other cultures such as Japan? These are some of the major questions addressed in this attempt to shed light on a familiar but neglected dimension of social life. "Mea Culpa is an important book. Tavuchis considers apologies between individuals, individuals and groups, and between groups ... His analysis is broad and interdisciplinary, drawing from sociology, philosophy, sociolinguistics, social psychology, anthropology, philology, law, and religion ... Tavuchis utilizes verbatim texts (from newspapers, novels, letters, press conferences) to develop his theory. He is particularly brilliant on the work of Erving Goffman ... Mea Culpa is a valuable contribution to social science."&#x2015;American Journal of Sociology</p><p>&#x201c;A book of elegance and grace in the grand sociological tradition, this work could become a classic. Tavuchis forces readers to recognize that all human contact is ultimately dyadic. . . . Apology in Japan is compared to its expression in the West, as is, to a lesser extent, secular apology and religious confession. The normative community, sacred or secular, required definitions of exactly what is forgivable and what is not; Tavuchis uses the perspective of Georg Simmel to examine this construct.&#x201d;&#x2014;Choice</p><h2>Loose-leaf Version for Macroeconomics in Modules</h2><p>Adapted by Paul Krugman and Robin Wells from their bestselling macroeconomics textbook,<i>Macroeconomics in Modules</i> is the only text for the principles of macroeconomics course organized in the supremely accessible, highly effective modular forma</p><p></p><h2>The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the Wall Street Legend</h2><p>"The sillier the market's behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor.

Graham was one of the greatest seers and bargain hunters in Wall Street history. Lowe, a veteran financial journalist and editor, showcases a wide range of Graham's writings, lectures, speeches, and interviews from the 1930s to the 1970s. A money manager, author, and adjunct professor at Columbia University, Graham became a millionaire by buying beaten-up stocks following the 1929 crash. Warren Buffett was an early enthusiast of Graham, whose style of investing and advice remain important nearly 25 years after his death. Graham preached the need to buy companies at a major discount to the rest of the market, based on factors such as book value, dividend yields, and price-to-earnings ratio. "Graham still has one of the largest and most loyal followings of any investment philosopher of this century," Lowe writes in the preface. "The more readers study Graham's value investing principles, the more loyal they are likely to become."<p> The book includes "Renaissance of Value," an address by Graham from 1974 that foreshadowed the bull market of the next decade; "Is American Business Worth More Dead than Alive?", Graham's three-part series in <i>Forbes</i> in 1932 that correctly heralded the deals on Wall Street at the time; and "Interviews with Benjamin Graham," three magazine articles about his musings in retirement after 60 years of investing. Graham, known for his books <i>Security Analysis</i> and <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, could be amazingly prescient. But he also made lots of mistakes, leading him to conclude that no one could be precise about the direction of the stock market. "The only thing that we can be pretty sure of, perhaps, is that we are acting reasonably and intelligently," he said in a lecture 50 years ago. "And if we are wrong, as we are likely to be, at least we have been intelligently wrong and not unintelligently wrong." Like most books by and about Graham, this belongs on the shelf of any value investor. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>"The search for intelligent investing should begin with the remarkable Benjamin Graham's timeless teachings.

The title poem follows a nineteen-year-old girl in Shanghai who uploaded her suicide onto Instagram. Other poems cross into animated worlds, examine robot culture, and haunt a necropolis for electronic waste. A fascinating sequence spanning the collection speaks in the voice of the international icon and first Chinese American movie star Anna May Wong, who travels through the history of cinema with a time machine, even past her death and into the future of film, where she finds she has no progeny. With a speculative imagination and a sharpened wit, Mao powerfully confronts the paradoxes of seeing and being seen, the intimacies made possible and ruined by the screen, and the many roles and representations that women of color are made to endure in order to survive a culture that seeks to consume them.</p></p><p><b>Sally Wen Mao</b> is the author of a previous poetry collection, <i>Mad Honey Symposium</i>.

For men and women searching for truth amid the noise and clutter, this principle could never be more crucial. And while the church is tossed about by the same uncertainty, Robert Wolgemuth's provocative <i>7 Things You Better Have Nailed Down Before All Hell Breaks Loose</i> puts a stake in the ground and says, "Here's something you can count on, no matter what." In life you don't rise to the level of your circumstances; you fall to the level of your training.

Its author, Marguerite Eymery Vallette (1860-1953), who used the pseudonym Rachilde, was a prolific novelist (over sixty works of fiction), playwright, literary critic and reviewer, and a forceful presence in French literary society of her time. The protagonist of the novel, Eliante Donalger, is in some sense an exaggerated double for her creator--bizarre in appearance, clothing, and interests. Instinctively grasping a medical and psychological truth that the turn-of-the-century scientific world was only beginning to understand, Eliante maintains that there is nothing "natural" about human sexual expression. She claims to be in love with an inanimate (though anthropomorphic and sexually ambiguous) object, a Greek amphora, and the novel traces the rivalry between this faithful partner and an ardent human suitor, a young medical student. It is only through juggling, both literally and metaphorically, that Eliante is able to use her seductive power to maintain desire. The surprise ending challenges the limits of such power in a controversial and surprising twist. Although Rachilde's work has been neglected in the past, the women's movement and feminist criticism have stimulated renewed interest in her fiction. The Juggler is a major rediscovery.<br></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>New Unger&#39;s Bible Handbook</h2><p>A new edition featuring revised text and hundreds of color pictures, making this volume an indispensable guide to understanding the Bible.

But the fact that this play exists in two early versions, printed in 1604 and 1616, has posed formidable problems for critics. How much of either version was written by Marlowe, and which is the more authentic? Is the play orthodox or radically interrogative? </p> <p> Michael Keefer&#x2019;s early work helped to establish the current consensus that the 1604 text was censored and revised; the Keefer edition, praised for its lucid introduction and scholarship, was the first to restore two displaced scenes to their correct place. Most competing editions presume that the 1604 text was printed from authorial manuscript, and that the 1616 text is of little substantive value. But in 2006 Keefer&#x2019;s fresh analysis of the evidence showed that the 1604 quarto&#x2019;s Marlovian scenes were printed from a corrupted manuscript, and that the 1616 quarto (though indeed censored and revised) preserves some readings earlier than those of the 1604 text. </p> <p> This edition has been updated and revised. Keefer&#x2019;s critical introduction reconstructs the ideological contexts that shaped and deformed the play, and the text is accompanied by textual and explanatory notes and excerpts from sources. </p></p><h2>Race, Sex, and Social Order in Early New Orleans (Early America: History, Context, Culture)</h2><p><p>Winner, 2009 Kemper and Leila Williams Prize in Louisiana History, The Historic New Orleans Collection and the Louisiana Historical Association</p><p>A microcosm of exaggerated societal extremes&#x2015;poverty and wealth, vice and virtue, elitism and equality&#x2015;New Orleans is a tangled web of race, cultural mores, and sexual identities. Jennifer M.

She recounts and analyzes the major conflicts that influenced New Orleanian culture: legal attempts to impose racial barriers and social order, political battles over propriety and freedom, and cultural clashes over place and progress. At each turn, Spear&#x2019;s narrative challenges the prevailing academic assumptions and supports her efforts to move exploration of racial formation away from cultural and political discourses and toward social histories.</p><p>Strikingly argued, richly researched, and methodologically sound, this wide-ranging look at how choices about sex triumphed over established class systems and artificial racial boundaries supplies a refreshing contribution to the history of early Louisiana.</p></p><p><p><b>Jennifer M.

Americans are living, he argues, in a profoundly transitional era, one in which the commonsense beliefs of the first truly modern society are being undermined by the still crude but irreversible forces set loose by technology&#x2019;s drastic revision of our everyday lives. He shows how this disruptive conflict between modern and post-modern modes of reasoning can be found in all advanced fields, including art, medicine, and science, and then traces its impact on our daily actions through such changes as the ways in which friends relate, money is made, crimes are committed, and mates are chosen.</p><p>Just as feudal values had to give way to a modern worldview that more effectively contained the new social reality generated by the printed book, so must our democracy reimagine itself in ways that can domesticate&#x2015;civilize rather than merely &#x201c;monetize&#x201d;&#x2015;a post-modern scene radically transformed by our digital machines.

Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding.

Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh discuss everything from the nature of proof to the Euclid myth, and mathematical aesthetics to non-Cantorian set theory. They make a convincing case for the idea that mathematics is not about eternal reality, but comprises "true facts about imaginary objects" and belongs among the human sciences.Phillip J.

Murphy and the Transformation of Los Angeles</h2><p>Franklin Murphy? It's not a name that is widely known; even during his lifetime the public knew little of him. But for nearly thirty years, Murphy was the dominant figure in the cultural development of Los Angeles. Behind the scenes, Murphy used his role as confidant, family friend, and advisor to the founders and scions of some of America's greatest fortunes&#x2015;Ahmanson, Rockefeller, Ford, Mellon, and Annenberg&#x2015;to direct the largesse of the wealthy into cultural institutions of his choosing. In this first full biography of Franklin D. Murphy (1916-994), Margaret Leslie Davis delivers the compelling story of how Murphy, as chancellor of UCLA and later as chief executive of the Times Mirror media empire, was able to influence academia, the media, and cultural foundations to reshape a fundamentally provincial city. <i>The Culture Broker </i>brings to light the influence of L.A.'s powerful families and chronicles the mixed motives behind large public endeavors. Channeling more than one billion dollars into the city's arts and educational infrastructure, Franklin Murphy elevated Los Angeles to a vibrant world-class city positioned for its role in the new era of global trade and cross-cultural arts.</p><p>"Los Angeles as a cultural capital did not exist in 1960 when Franklin D.

Established by papal bull in 1478, the first task of the Spanish Inquisition was to question Jewish converts to Christianity and to expose and execute those found guilty of reversion. Authorities then turned on Spanish Jews in general, sending 300,000 into exile. Next in line were humanists and Lutherans. No rank was exempt. Children informed on their parents, merchants on their rivals, and priests upon their bishops. Those denounced were guilty unless they could prove their innocence. Nearly 32,000 people were publicly burned at the stake; the &#x201c;fortunate&#x201d; ones were flogged, fined, or imprisoned.<br> Joseph P�rez tells the history of the Spanish Inquisition from its medieval beginnings to its nineteenth-century ending. He discovers its origins in fear and jealousy and its longevity in usefulness to the state. He explores the inner workings of its councils, and shows how its officers, inquisitors, and leaders lived and worked. He describes its techniques of interrogation and torture, and shows how it refined displays of punishment as instruments of social control. The author ends his fascinating account by assessing the impact of the Inquisition over three and a half centuries on Spain&#x2019;s culture, economy, and intellectual life.</p><p>This is the story of a battle for a unified faith that plunged Spain into 350 years of terror.

How will we communicate without it? Are there any indications of new, emergent codes? Is human communication going through a mutation? These are only some of the provocative questions posed by Vil�m Flusser in <em>Into Immaterial Culture</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The four essays of this book were delivered as a series of lectures at the School of Communication and the Arts of the University of S�o Paulo in August of 1986, one year after the publication of the first Brazilian edition of<em> Towards a Philosophy of Photography</em>,&nbsp;published as <em>A Filosofia da Caixa Preta</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through these four short essays, Flusser presents, in a nutshell, his communications theory. Their style is condensed, with a series of quick-fire sentences, which are best read in conjunction with his major works of the same period. However, for a fist time reader of his work, these four lectures are a good introduction to some of Flusser's polemic and provocative concepts regarding human communication, its future, and its ethical, aesthetic, and epistemological implications; a vision that is paradoxically utopian and dystopian.</p></p><p>The philosopher Vil�m Flusser was born in Prague&nbsp;in 1920 but emigrated to Brazil, fleeing from Nazi persecution, at the outbreak of war in 1939, arriving&nbsp;in Rio de Janeiro at the end of 1940, with his wife and parents-in-law, after a short stay in London. The Flussers settled in S�o Paulo during the 1940s, where they lived for thirty-two years. In the early years of the 1970s they moved back to Europe, settling first in Italy, and subsequently in Robion, France, where they lived until Vil�m Flusser's untimely death in 1991 after a car crash, as he left Prague at the end of a symposium. During the years he lived in Brazil, Flusser wrote for several Brazilian periodicals and taught at different academic institutions, among them, the University of S�o Paulo, the Brazilian Institute of Philosophy, and the Institute of Technology and Aeronautics. His first two books, "Lingua e Realidade" and "A Hist�ria do Diabo," were published in Brazil during the 1960s. In the late 1970s, and throughout the 1980s, Flusser travelled most of Europe lecturing and participating in conferences and symposia, during which time he published his most well-known titles. He came to prominence in the field of Media Philosophy after publishing his seminal book "Towards a Philosophy of Photography" in 1984, shortly followed by "Ins Universum der Technischen Bilder" in 1985, and "Die Schrift. Hat Schreiben Zukunft?" in 1987. As a polyglot, Flusser wrote in four different languages, German, Portuguese, English, and French.

In this path-breaking collection of Greek and Roman writings on magic and the occult, Georg Luck provides a comprehensive sourcebook and introduction to magic as it was practiced by witches and sorcerers, <i>magi</i> and astrologers, in the Greek and Roman worlds. </p><p>In this new edition, Luck has gathered and translated 130 ancient texts dating from the eighth century BCE through the fourth century CE. Thoroughly revised, this volume offers several new elements: a comprehensive general introduction, an epilogue discussing the persistence of ancient magic into the early Christian and Byzantine eras, and an appendix on the use of mind-altering substances in occult practices. Also added is an extensive glossary of Greek and Latin magical terms. </p><p>In <i>Arcana Mundi</i> Georg Luck presents a fascinating&#x2015;and at times startling&#x2015;alternative vision of the ancient world. "For a long time it was fashionable to ignore the darker and, to us, perhaps, uncomfortable aspects of everyday life in Greece and Rome," Luck has written. "But we can no longer idealize the Greeks with their 'artistic genius' and the Romans with their 'sober realism.' Magic and witchcraft, the fear of daemons and ghosts, the wish to manipulate invisible powers&#x2015;all of this was very much a part of their lives." </p></p><p><p><b>Georg Luck </b> is professor emeritus in the Department of Classics at the Johns Hopkins University.

It will rapidly and deservedly become one of the standard works on magic and the occult in the Greek and Roman worlds."</p> (<i>Ancient Philosophy</i>)<br><br><p>"An excellent translation of ancient texts on the subject, but it's a lot more than that.

Questions of justice are questions about what people are due, but what that means in practice depends on context. Depending on context, the formal question of what people are due is answered by principles of desert, reciprocity, equality, or need. Justice, thus, is a constellation of elements that exhibit a degree of integration and unity, but the integrity of justice is limited, in a way that is akin to the integrity of a neighborhood rather than that of a building. A theory of justice is a map of that neighborhood.</p><p>What is justice? Questions of justice are questions about what people are due, but what that means in practice depends on context.

This period saw the opening of arguments on the nature of man, truth, the place of God, and the international circulation of ideas, people and gold.

Typhoid Mary, an Irish immigrant cook who unwittingly brought death and disease to those who ate her fare, was in 1907 the first person to be identified as a healthy typhoid carrier; she was also the only one to be imprisoned for life as a menace to public health. Leavitt, who teaches women's studies and the history of medicine at the University of Wisconsin, expertly retells Typhoid Mary's story from several perspectives--those of the then-new science of bacteriology, public health policy, the law, the social prejudices of the period, the media, and Mary herself. Leavitt demonstrates how each of these interpretations reinforces or conflicts with the others, leaving the reader to puzzle out the truths of the differing narratives. Interest in Typhoid Mary did not end with her death in 1938, and Leavitt shows how she has been depicted since then in theatrical presentations, novels, and magazine articles. Indeed, the main question her story raises is especially pertinent in today's era of AIDs and drug-resistant tuberculosis: How is it possible to protect the public health from carriers of diseases without infringing on individuals' civil liberties? Leavitt's response is that programs that stigmatize or impoverish people, or that employ coercive mass isolation, are undemocratic and ultimately ineffective. By bringing to light the story of an individual both stigmatized and isolated, she makes a vivid and worthy contribution to the search for humane and equitable answers.

This unique study of government is the culmination of the work of the late S. E. Finer, one of the leading political scientists of the twentieth century.</p><p>F.B.A., Fellow of All Souls and Emeritus Gladstone Professor of Government and Public Administration in the University of Oxford (d.1993)`No review can fully capture the breadth and accessibility of S. E. Finer's posthumous magnum opus ... its clarity and readability must be emphasized ... Finer constantly reminds us of exceptions that explain the richness and diversity of polities.'<br>John R. Cramsie, History<br><br>`This is political science on the grandest scale: three volumes that provide a history of successive forms of government throughout the world from the earliest times to the present day ... Finer presents material on political systems that most political scientists will be completely unfamiliar<br>with, and gives fresh insights into systems that they might have thought they knew ... What makes it a great book, and one that deserves to be read by all students of government, is Finer's remarkable ability to classify and compare across the entire universe of known systems of government. It is<br>not simply the scholarship and erudition that is breathtaking, but also the confident, clear and imaginative use of comparative tools to describe the significance of the systems of government.'<br>Edward Page, Public Policy<br><br>`Finer's magisterial History of Government is, indeed, 'the mix of scholastic erudition with street-level realism' that the authors of the preface claim it is for. His three volumes engagingly and convincingly blend usually precise scholarship; imaginative flare and insight; a genius for<br>comparison, contrast, and analogy; great forthrightness; and essential knowledge for the formation of and commentary upon current public policy. Historians, social scientists broadly conceived, statesmen, and journalists will be indebted to him for a long time for this ambitious work. His range of<br>dramatic narrative, incisive analysis and interpretation, instructive comparisons, studied repetitions, and well-chosen emphases arrested at least this reader's attention and compelled his fascinated interest. Finer weaves everything together into a rich texture and overarching thesis so that...his<br>work will stimulate scholars for generations to come.'<br>Donald A.

Sass, a clinical psychologist, explores the bizarre experiences of schizophrenia (and related conditions) through a comparison with the works of various artists and writers, including Franz Kafka, Paul Valery, Samuel Beckett, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Giorgio de Chirico, and Marcel Duchamp, and by considering the ideas of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, William James, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida.<br>The similarities between madness and modernism are striking: defiance of authority and convention; an extreme, often dizzying relativism, which can culminate in paralysis; nihilism and all-embracing irony; a tantalizing, uncanny, but always frustrating sense of revelation; obliteration of standard forms of time and narrative; pervasive dehumanization; and disappearance of external reality in favor of the omnipotent ego or, alternatively, dissolution of all sense of selfhood.<br>This rigorously argued, gracefully written book offers a startlingly new vision of schizophrenia, an illness long recognized as the greatest challenge to psychiatric or psychological understanding. Conventionally seen as a loss of rationality, perhaps involving a return to some infantile or bestial condition, schizophrenia, according to Sass, is better understood as, in a sense, a disease of hyperrationality, with detachment from action, emotions, and the body and entrapment in forms of acute self-consciousness and heightened awareness. Sass refuses to romanticize the schizophrenic as a heroic rebel, mystic, or passionate Wildman, arguing instead that this condition echoes many of the most alienating aspects of modern life. In an epilogue and appendix, he considers whether modern culture might actively contribute to the genesis or shaping of schizophrenic forms of pathology, and he discusses the possible role of abnormalities of the brain.</p><p><b>Louis A.

Taking alliance theory as a starting point, the authors argue that the alliance provides an ideal case study to examine how the political development and economic growth of junior partners impact an alliance. As South Korea&#39;s capabilities and ambitions have grown, the alliance has evolved from an asymmetric regional security relationship to an economic partnership with global interests, while China&#39;s rise and North Korea&#39;s nuclear development mean that South Korea remains of strategic importance for American interests in East Asia.

Joanna Grossman and Lawrence Friedman show how vast, oceanic changes in society have reshaped and reconstituted the American family. Women and children have gained rights and powers, and novel forms of family life have emerged. The family has more or less dissolved into a collection of independent individuals with their own wants, desires, and goals. Modern family law, as always, reflects the brute social and cultural facts of family life.</p><br><p> The story of family law in the twentieth century is complex. This was the century that said goodbye to common-law marriage and breach-of-promise lawsuits. This was the century, too, of the sexual revolution and women's liberation, of gay rights and cohabitation. Marriage lost its powerful monopoly over legitimate sexual behavior. Couples who lived together without marriage now had certain rights. Gay marriage became legal in a handful of jurisdictions. By the end of the century, no state still prohibited same-sex behavior. Children in many states could legally have two mothers or two fathers. No-fault divorce became cheap and easy. And illegitimacy lost most of its social and legal stigma. These changes were not smooth or linear--all met with resistance and provoked a certain amount of backlash. Families took many forms, some of them new and different, and though buffeted by the winds of change, the family persisted as a central institution in society. <i>Inside the Castle</i> tells the story of that institution, exploring the ways in which law tried to penetrate and control this most mysterious realm of personal life.</p></p><p><p>"This wonderful history of twentieth-century family law blows like a strong fresh wind through the fog of myth that pervades debates over traditional families and their decline. Deeply learned but also clear and lively, this book explains how the law of marriage, divorce, parentage, and inheritance has responded to social changes that have eroded old bonds of intimacy and dependence while creating new ones. This is simply the best overview of family law in print."<b>--Robert W. Gordon, Yale Law School</b></p><p>"Grossman and Friedman provide the first complete and reliable survey of American family law in the twentieth century. Along the way, they offer an unusually expansive portrait of how the law has changed and suggestive explorations of many of the recent transformations to American family life. Marriage, divorce, sex, domestic violence, care, and the intergenerational transmission of wealth all fall within their view. <i>Inside the Castle</i> will be the essential starting point for anyone interested in learning about the subject for years to come."<b>--Hendrik Hartog, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is a bold, ambitious, and remarkably comprehensive book. Moving beyond the legal community and providing a window into the actual functioning of America's diverse families, this book shows that family law isn't so much generated by judges and legislators, but by ordinary and extraordinary individuals."<b>--Steven Mintz, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Effectively organized and wonderfully accessible, this engrossing book illuminates the enormous transformations experienced by families, and the laws governing them, in the twentieth century.

A good portion of the text focuses on Washington's military career, including details of individual campaigns and battles. The general's courage, bravado, and intangible leadership qualities emerge through descriptions of his wartime actions and through the words of those who fought with and against him. The harshness of war comes through in sometimes gruesome detail, showing the cruelty that prevailed on both sides. Washington unhesitatingly orders the execution of mutineers from his own army, judging that a more merciful decision would have cost more in the long run. Marrin clearly admires his subject, yet carefully discusses his flaws and errors. The author raises questions and presents differing views without interrupting the flow of the narrative. Well-chosen quotations, many from Washington's own writings, enliven the text as well. Numerous historical drawings, paintings, and etchings help to bring the period alive. Milton Meltzer's George Washington and the Birth of Our Nation (Watts, 1986; o.p.) and Mary Pope Osborne's George Washington (Dial, 1991; o.p.) are equally fine biographies.

It also examines the wider issues of script and writing in ancient Egypt and beyond, for example, the relationship between hieroglyphs and art, the social prestige of literacy, and the practical aspects of writing (scibal exquipment and training). Other issues in decipherment are also discussed, such as Linear B and Meroitic, a language which still remains to be read.</p><p>In 1799, while Napoleon's troops battled the fierce Mamelukes in Egypt's Western Delta, a French engineer discovered a giant granite slab that contained strange symbols and Greek letters. Two Egyptologists, the British-born Thomas Young and the astounding young French linguistic polymath Jean-Fran�ois Champollion, fought to decipher the confounding script in an epic scientific battle. In 1822 Champollion finally broke through 3,000 years of mystery and revealed the Egyptian demotic and hieroglyphic system of writing--forever changing our view of history in the process.<p> <i>Cracking Codes</i>, by Richard Parkinson, the British Museum's assistant keeper of Egyptian antiquities, is a companion volume for the museum's bicentennial exhibition of what has come to be known as the Rosetta stone. With 32 color and 200 black-and-white illustrations ranging from limestone fragments to whole statues, illustrated papyrus, and evocative wall paintings, Parkinson shows how Champollion's piercing of the mists of time has enabled the ancient Egyptians to speak to modern civilizations. Parkinson's essays on the importance of writing to human civilization and the birth of Egyptology are equally insightful. "The decipherment of the Egyptian scripts is not a single event that occurred in 1822," he writes, but "a continuous process that is repeated at every reading of a text or artifact. Like any process of reading, it is a dialogue." <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p><b>Richard Parkinson</b> is Assistant Keeper in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum specializing in hieratic papyri and epigraphy.

In this lively and thought-provoking book, John Kricher demonstrates that nature in fact is not in balance, nor has it ever been at any stage in Earth's history. He explains how and why this notion of a natural world in balance has endured for so long, and he shows why, in these times of extraordinary human influence on the planet's ecosystems, it is critical that we accept and understand that evolution is a fact of life, and that ecology is far more dynamic than we ever imagined.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Balance of Nature</i> traces the fascinating history of the science of ecology and evolutionary biology, from the discipline's early innovators to the advent of Darwin and evolution, to the brilliant and inquisitive scientific minds of today. Blending insights and entertaining stories from his own remarkable life in science, Kricher reveals how evolution is a powerful engine that drives ecological change, how nature is constantly in flux and, in effect, quite naturally out of balance--and how notions to the contrary are misguided and ultimately hazardous to us all.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Balance of Nature</i> forcefully argues that an understanding of the dynamic nature of ecology and evolution is essential to formulating policies of environmental ethics to guide humanity toward a more responsible stewardship of our planet's ecosystems.</p></p><p><p>"John Kricher masterfully describes the ancient origins of the concept of a balance of nature and its unquestioned incorporation into the thinking of many ecologists and conservationists. This concept implies an overarching purpose or design in the natural world, making it inconsistent with our understanding of how evolution works. Kricher shows that we can understand and protect natural ecosystems better by rejecting the assumption that nature is a well-designed machine and accepting the true complexity created by numerous interacting species."<b>--Robert Askins, Connecticut College</b></p><p>"This is a highly readable account of ecology, rich in substance, metaphor, and examples. The author's main goal is to puncture the cozy idea that nature is in a state of balance. While the concept of balance fitted the philosophy of some of the ancient Greeks and their intellectual descendants, John Kricher explains how it has repeatedly failed the test of empirical science. Nature, he shows, is much more interesting."<b>--Peter R. Grant, Princeton University</b></p><p>"A deft and inviting tour of ecology and evolution, a book of revelation about the balance of nature that really counts, namely that between ourselves and the living planet. This is an appealing read that reveals the most important story of human history."<b>--Thomas E. Lovejoy, president of the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment</b></p><p>"Kricher's new book challenges our long-held belief in the balance of nature. Presenting fascinating evidence in a highly readable style, Kricher makes the case that no, there is no balance within nature, but yes, we need a sounder ethic that trumpets the urgency that we must save our environment--now!"<b>--Herb Raffaele, United States Fish and Wildlife Service</b></p><p>"Kricher is an excellent storyteller and this is an important story to tell. I thoroughly enjoyed this little book. It is chock full of interesting ideas that challenge conventional wisdom. <i>The Balance of Nature</i> is a fun read throughout, and will appeal to a broad range of readers both within and outside the discipline."<b>--Richard Karban, coauthor of <i>How to Do Ecology</i></b></p><p>"Kricher dispels the popularly held notion that nature exists in some single, harmonious balance, and shows how, as a consequence, we need to change the way we view nature. His passion and breadth of understanding come through very clearly. <i>The Balance of Nature</i> is a charming and very readable book."<b>--Oswald Schmitz, Yale University</b></p><b>John Kricher</b> is the A.

Focusing on developments over the past decade, Connolly provides in-depth readings of selected recent works by twenty-four different artists, ranging from multi-screen projections to site-specific installations and feature-length films. She also explores changing structures of exhibition and curation, tracing the circulation of film and video works within public art contexts, galleries, museums, biennial exhibitions and art fairs. Providing a chapter on the role of public funding in the market for artists&#x2019; film and video, <i>The Place of Artists&#x2019; Cinema </i>will appeal to both curators and artists.</p></p><p><p><b>Maeve Connolly </b>is a lecturer in film and animation at the Institute of Art, Design, and Technology in Dublin.</p>&#34;Maeve Connolly is the first film scholar in any language to explicate in depth contemporary artists&#39; insights on the cinema, new media, photography and cinephilia. She engages the specialist as well as the educated reader, by addressing the difference between information and translation, animation and re-enactment in the context of major art exhibitions all over the world. In discussing installations, immersions, performances and interactive experiences, Connolly demonstrates the central placement of the cinema as the source of creative and conceptual inspiration for the media of the future.&#34; - Angela Dalle Vacche, Professor of Film Studies, Georgia Institute of Technology &#39;The Place of Artists&#39; Cinema&#39;s rigorous interdisciplinary inquiry into the conditions of production and exhibition associated with post-1990&#39;s artists&#39; cinema, both inside and outside the institutional context of contemporary art, is a welcome and long overdue contribution to the extant literature.&#39; Kate Mondloch, &#39;Placing Artists&#39; Cinema&#39;, Jump Cut 52, Summer 2010 http://www.ejumpcut.org/currentissue/mondloch/text.html &#39;This is a timely work - one that formulates ideas about the flowering of film and moving image work that has taken place since the 1990s: something that is only now being reflected upon. As a contribution to this debate, Maeve Connolly&#39;s book is a welcome and a critical one&#39;. Mo White, Review of The Place of Artists&#39; Cinema, The Art Book, Volume 17, Issue 2 May 2010, pp 65-66 &#39;[Connolly] pays particular attention to how social relations are structured within these spaces, and to the relationship that moving images within the gallery have to notions of place and site. [...] One of the most interesting chapters in the book focuses critical attention on attempts to make film and video legible within the discourse of art and therefore legible to the market.&#39; Dan Kidner, Review of The Place of Artists&#39; Cinema: Space, Site and Screen, LuxOnline, October 2009. http://www.lux.org.uk/blog/dan-kidners-round-recent-books-artists-film &#39;The concept of &#39;artists&#39; cinema&#39; is tirelessly operationalised and consistently enlivened across five detailed, rather different and differentiating (but always cogent) substantive chapters. [...] Connolly&#39;s arguments force us to think of &#39;artists&#39; cinema&#39; as a form or practice that raises interesting questions, for example, about the nature of &#39;place&#39;, about the &#39;market&#39; or &#39;post-Fordist capital&#39;, about the notion of the &#39;public space&#39;, about the status and scope of &#39;events&#34; Robert Porter, Variant 36, Winter 2009. http://www.variant.org.uk/36texts/ArtistsCinema.html &#39;Focusing on developments since the mid 1990s, Connolly [...] examines the various ways in which contemporary art practitioners have claimed the narrative techniques and modes of production associated with cinema as a cultural form. She notes that the explicit commercialisation of film and television production over the past decade, especially within the UK context, is likely to have impelled certain practitioners towards the gallery. [...] Thus The Place of Artists&#39; Cinema [...] opens up a new set of questions about cinema and the place of artists within the public sphere.&#39; Bethsheba Achitsa, Artmatters.info: Flaunting Arts and Culture in Africa, September 2009 http://artmatters.info/?p=1648</p><h2>Social Psychology</h2><p>When Elliot Aronson, Timothy Wilson, and Robin Akert started with the first edition of <i>Social Psychology </i>their overriding goal was simple but ambitious: capture the excitement of social psychology in a textbook. Now in its sixth edition, the authors have discovered -&nbsp;through many kind letters and e-mail from professors and students -&nbsp;that they have succeeded in making their book an enjoyable, fascinating story, not just a dry report of facts and figures. In their work they have found that social psychology comes alive for students when they understand the whole context of the field: how theories inspire research, why research is performed as it is, how further research triggers yet new avenues of study.&nbsp;The authors&nbsp;have reached students by conveying their own fascination with the research process in a down-to-earth, meaningful way, yet have done so without sacrificing a firm&nbsp;foundation on which to build the reader's&nbsp;understanding. Here, in its sixth edition, the authors present a rigorous, scientific approach to social psychology in a&nbsp;manner that continues to build on the text's legacy of engaging and fascinating students.</p><p><p><b>Elliot Aronson</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Elliot Aronson is one of the most renowned social psychologists in the world.

It goes into greater detail than ever previously available in English. Because the emphasis in Chinese mathematics is on algorithms rather than proofs, readers will find results such as Bezout&#39;s theorem and Horner&#39;s method appearing in a very different context from the familiar tradition of Euclidean deductive geometry. The Chinese always preferred algebraic methods, and by the 13th century A.D. they were the best algebraists in the world. The original Chinese point of view is retained by the translators. They have supplemented the text with short explanatory comments and references to all relevant reference sources available in the West. An extensive bibliography is included, creating a work which will appeal to general readers interested in Chinese history as well as historians of mathematics.</p><p>Text: English, Chinese (translation)</p><h2>Guitar Rhythm and Techniques For Dummies, Book + Online Video and Audio Instruction: Book + Online Video and Audio Instruction</h2><p><b>Improve your guitar-playing rhythm, feel, and timing</b> <p>If you want to improve your timing, sharpen your technique, or get inspired by new ideas, <i>Guitar Rhythm &amp; Technique For Dummies</i> breaks down the basics of reading, counting, strumming, and picking rhythms on guitar to make you an ace on the axe in no time.

Shortly thereafter he wrote a sequel, <em>Twenty Years After</em>, that resumed the adventures of his swashbuckling heroes.<br><br> Later, toward the end of his career, Dumas wrote <em>The Red Sphinx</em>, another direct sequel to <em>The Three Musketeers</em> that begins, not twenty years later, but a mere twenty days afterward. <em>The Red Sphinx</em> picks up right where the <em>The Three Musketeers</em> left off, continuing the stories of Cardinal Richelieu, Queen Anne, and King Louis XIII&#x2015;and introducing a charming new hero, the Comte de Moret, a real historical figure from the period. A young cavalier newly arrived in Paris, Moret is an illegitimate son of the former king, and thus half-brother to King Louis. The French Court seethes with intrigue as king, queen, and cardinal all vie for power, and young Moret soon finds himself up to his handsome neck in conspiracy, danger&#x2015;and passionate romance!<br><br> Dumas wrote seventy-five chapters of <em>The Red Sphinx</em>, all for serial publication, but he never quite finished it, and so the novel languished for almost a century before its first book publication in France in 1946. While Dumas never completed the book, he had earlier written a separate novella, The Dove, that recounted the final adventures of Moret and Cardinal Richelieu.<br><br> Now for the first time, in one cohesive narrative, <em>The Red Sphinx</em> and <em>The Dove</em> make a complete and satisfying storyline&#x2015;a rip-roaring novel of historical adventure, heretofore unknown to English-language readers, by the great Alexandre Dumas, king of the swashbucklers.</p><p><p>One of the most famous French writers of the nineteenth century, <strong>Alexandre Dumas</strong> (1802&#x2013;1870) first achieved success in the literary world a playwright, before turning his hand to writing novels. In two years from 1844 to 1845, he published two enormous books, <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> and <em>The Three Musketeers</em>. Both novels have sold millions of copies worldwide.</p><p><strong>Lawrence Ellsworth</strong> is the pen name of Lawrence Schick.

The study is based primarily on firsthand descriptions of the materials and techniques that artists used to make paintings. It is written to be accessible and interesting to curators, art historians, and painters, as well as conservators.<br><br>The period covered in this book is best understood divided roughly into two parts: 1860 to 1910 and 1910 to 1945. Between 1860 and 1910, the predominant theme is the increased number of Americans who traveled to Europe for instruction, resulting in an explosion of transplanted techniques. The lessons they learned there were often recombined in unique ways as they developed their own styles. We know about their approaches from letters, diaries, colormen&#x2019;s catalogues, books, and other printed sources.<br><br>The following period, from 1910 to 1945, saw a much greater increase in books and other printed sources of information. It was marked by a fundamental change in the attitudes of painters toward their materials. Artists began to turn away from commercially made products and began once again to make their own media and grounds from raw materials. Because of the explosion of information in the twentieth century, the authors moved away from devoting chapters to individual artists and instead included short sections on techniques of many different artists, interwoven with discussions of more general topics. An epilogue summarizes the lessons American painters&#x2019; experiences over 250 years can hold for contemporary artists interested in the long-term preservation of their paintings.<br></p><p>Lance Mayer and Gay Myers are both conservators in the partnership Lance Mayer and Gay Myers, Conservators LLC.<br>&#x201c;In keeping with their impressive achievement in a preceding book on the subject . . . authors Mayer and Myers (both experienced conservators) maintain a high level of scholarship. . . .

And while many parents screen the content of games to protect their children from violent and sexual themes, few understand the forces causing their children to become hooked on the &#34;digital drug.&#34; This book arms parents with the facts they need and concrete steps to protect our children from this very real epidemic.

Bloody and spectacular battles. This modern retelling of Macbeth, enhanced with superbly evocative full-color art throughout, captures all the drama of Shakespeare&#x2019;s classic play. Written by an outstanding scholar, the language is simple yet eloquent, and draws young readers into the story with superb dialogue, vivid description, and careful attention to the flow of events. The skillful blending of Shakespeare&#x2019;s own lines with modern language and illuminating information enhances youngsters&#x2019; involvement and comprehension. There&#x2019;s background on Shakespeare and the play, answers to FAQs, and a Who&#x2019;s Who of the characters. Young Reader&#x2019;s Shakespeare is a powerful visual and reading experience.<br><i>A Selection of Scholastic Book Clubs.</i><br><br><b>Lynne Cannoy </b>was a professional designer, art director, and teacher before pursuing a career in illustration.

This is her first book.<br></p><p>Grade 5-10&#x2013;This prose retelling of one of Shakespeare's most popular and frequently taught plays is a good introduction for readers who might not be ready for the original. It is told in short, two- to three-page chapters and is intended for a slightly older audience than Bruce Coville's picture book <i>William Shakespeare's</i> Macbeth (Dial, 1997). McKeown incorporates many of the most significant poetic passages and images from the play into his clearly written, sometimes slangy narrative, and there is also some literary explication. The book includes a short introduction to the play and its history, a section called "Questions People Ask about <i>Macbeth</i>," and a listing of characters. The angular, almost Cubist illustrations are appropriate to the dark subject matter and suggest the tortured states of the Scottish nobleman and his wife. While nothing substitutes for reading the real thing, this retelling would be helpful to students who are attempting to understand the basics.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen E. Gruver, Burlington County Library, Westampton, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 5-8. As in his <i>Young Readers Shakespeare: Hamlet</i> (2003), McKeown recasts the play into a short novel-like format, adding small amounts of physical detail and internalizing most of the speeches. He preserves many fragments of the more significant lines as dialogue ("Eye of newt and tongue of dog, adder's fork and blind worm's sting . ."), sometimes giving them a contemporary flavor: "I'll tell you what," says Banquo. "If you should be king I promise I won't try to kill ou, if you don't try to kill my children." Illustrated with scenes of pale, flinty-faced figures, opening with a tantalizing introduction, and closing with FAQs (plus an index!), this version will give modern readers a steadier leg up on understanding the play's dark events, twisted characters, and historical context than Lorenz Graham's graphic novel adaptation (1997) or Lois Burdett's entry in the Shakespeare Can Be Fun series (1996). <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Rooted in artistic practices of the 1960s and 1970s, the idea of situation has evolved and transcended these in the current context of globalization. This anthology offers key writings on areas of art practice and theory related to situation, including notions of the site specific, the artist as ethnographer or fieldworker, the relation between action and public space, the meaning of place and locality, and the crucial role of the curator in recent situation specific art. </p><p>In North America and Europe, the site-specific is often viewed in terms of resistance to art's commoditization, while elsewhere situation-specific practices have defied institutions of authority.

Until now, most of his work has been available only in small editions and chapbooks. This collection of all Prynne's books, from The Kitchen Poems (1968) to For the Monogram (1997), is therefore a literary event without recent parallel. Prynne, who teaches at Cambridge University, is the center of a group known as the Cambridge poets. His peculiarly local influence is no accident, since he has stayed away from large-scale publishing; he made this decision partly to honor the poems' quiet, hermetic quality, and partly as a response to the absorption of experimental poetics into academic parlance-a parallel, for Prynne, to capitalism's absorption of opposition. Prynne's difficulties demand, and reward, close attention. His early work shows what he learned from Charles Olson, switching from personal to political to geological frames of reference in a single phrase. Enjoyable for their complex logic and concealed wit, these early poems often alternate incompatible metres, creating a distinctive discursive cascade. Next to these recalcitrant works Prynne has placed sequences like "Day Light Songs," more lyrical, less dense and equally accomplished: "And so when it does/ rain &amp; will glide/ down our necks like/ glances into/ the soul, drop/ lets work their/ way forward the sinus/ is truly the scent/ of the earth, upraised." While never a rabble-rousing avant-gardist, Prynne continues to make startling discoveries. Not-You (1993) introduces staggered lines that fall together like tone clusters: "Her pan click/ elb/ second fix/ for them/ pencil/ breather park/ over/ talk at small to." Her Weasels Wild Returning (1994) fuses its dense phrasings to create a consistent persona: "I saw/ her wings in speedy strip like a shadow in the sand/ or in growth like natural reason, her heart so vast..." Prynne's reticence belies his powers-powers many more readers can now hear.

Still largely unfamiliar to American readers, Prynne has authored more than 20 volumes in England over the past 30 years. This is his first collected edition since 1982, and it includes works from almost every one of his published volumes. A stylist in the high modernist tradition, Prynnes lapidary phraseology and interior rhetoric (there is / no end to the peace claimed by the sick / body and no relief for the mere lack of / fever by which now I lean from the step / and touch at the bare twigs with my wrist) will not be to everyones taste today, but his voice is strong enough to carry into laterand, one hopes, healthierages to find the audience he deserves. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Examining one year's proceedings of the court of Aintab, an Anatolian city that had recently been conquered by the Ottoman sultanate, Peirce argues that local residents responded to new opportunities and new constraints by negotiating flexible legal practices. Their actions and the different compromises they reached in court influenced how society viewed gender and also created a dialogue with the ruling regime over mutual rights and obligations. Locating its discussion of gender and legal issues in the context of the changing administrative practices and shifting power relations of the period, <i>Morality Tales </i>argues that it was only in local interpretation that legal rules acquired vitality and meaning.</p><p>"Leslie Peirce has produced a meticulously researched and gloriously imagined work of historical scholarship. Her deep familiarity with the city of Aintab (today&#x2019;s Gaziantep) shines through on every page as she recreates the world of the city and its inhabitants in the middle of the sixteenth century. Using a wide variety of sources, Peirce departs from state-centered approach of much of Ottoman historiography and asks instead how individuals understood themselves and their place in Ottoman society. Her answers take us into areas of Ottoman society that are still obscure. We see Aintabans grappling with issues of class, morality, heresy, and the differences between men and women. Throughout, Peirce excavates the complicated relationship between a society that understands itself as Islamic but whose sources of meaning and order are not confined to the religious tradition."&#x2015;Molly Greene, Princeton University<br><br>"This is another masterpiece that will, like Leslie Peirce&#x2019;s first book, become a classic. Once again, she shows a special talent for raising relevant issues that have remained unexplored and shedding light on older issues with illuminating interpretations. . . . The heterogeneity of law and the variability of justice emerge clearly, as do the flexibility and fluidity of legal practices, justice as a process not a structure, and law as a product of debate among providers and users."&#x2015;Lucette Valensi, author of <i>La Fuite en Egypte: Histoires d'Orient et d'Occident, 2002</i><br><br>"Leslie Peirce guides the reader through the Anatolian town of Aintab, twenty-five years after its incorporation into the Ottoman Empire. Using the local court records for the year 1540-1541 and the fascinating accounts of women talking�sometimes even shouting and cursing�their way into court, she reveals the intricacies of the legal system at the crossroads of imperial law and local custom. . . . Morality Tales is a must for Ottomanists, to whom it will offer a truly innovative methodology and a brilliant portrayal and analysis of this complex and fascinating period. More important, however, this book will reveal to a wider audience that Ottoman history has a lot to contribute to the understanding of early modern society and politics."&#x2015;Edhem Eldem, Bogazi�i University, Istanbul<b>Leslie Peirce </b>is Professor of History and Near Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of <i>The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire </i>(1993).</p><h2>The Viking World (Routledge Worlds)</h2><p><p>Filling a gap in the literature for an academically oriented volume on the Viking period, this unique book is a one-stop authoritative introduction to all the latest research in the field.</p> <p>Bringing together today&#x2019;s leading scholars, both established seniors and younger, cutting-edge academics, Stefan Brink and Neil Price have constructed the first single work to gather innovative research from a spectrum of disciplines (including archaeology, history, philology, comparative religion, numismatics and cultural geography) to create the most comprehensive Viking Age book of its kind ever attempted. </p> <p></p> <p>Consisting of longer articles providing overviews of important themes, supported by shorter papers focusing on material of particular interest, this comprehensive volume covers such wide-ranging topics as social institutions, spatial issues, the Viking Age economy, warfare, beliefs, language, voyages, and links with medieval and Christian Europe.</p> <p></p> <p>This original work, specifically oriented towards a university audience and the educated public, will have a self-evident place as an undergraduate course book and will be a standard work of reference for all those in the field.</p></p><p><p><strong>Stefan Brink </strong>is Professor of Scandinavian Studies and Director of Centre for Scandinavian Studies at the University of Aberdeen.</p> <p><strong>Neil Price</strong> is Associate Professor of Archaeology, Conservation, and Historical Studies at Oslo University, and Docent in Archaeology at The University of Uppsala, Sweden. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&#x2018;Editors Brink and Price are to be commended for coordinating this impressive volume.

It was the first time an American president had acknowledged the existence of this rapidly growing segment of the population in such a public forum. And yet the reasons why more and more people are turning away from religion are still poorly understood. <br><br>In <em>Faith No More</em>, Phil Zuckerman draws on in-depth interviews with people who have left religion to find out what's really behind the process of losing one's faith. According to a 2008 study, so many Americans claim no religion (15%, up from 8% in 1990) that this category now outranks every other religious group except Catholics and Baptists. Exploring the deeper stories within such survey data, Zuckerman shows that leaving one's faith is a highly personal, complex, and drawn-out process. And he finds that, rather than the clich� of the angry, nihilistic atheist, apostates are life-affirming, courageous, highly intelligent and inquisitive, and deeply moral. Zuckerman predicts that this trend toward nonbelief will likely continue and argues that the sooner we recognize that religion is frequently and freely rejected by all sorts of men and women, the sooner our understanding of the human condition will improve. <br><br>The first book of its kind, <em>Faith No More</em> will appeal to anyone interested in the "New Atheism" and indeed to anyone wishing to more fully understand our changing relationship to religious faith.</p><p><br><strong>Phil Zuckerman</strong> is Professor of Sociology at Pitzer College. He is the author of <em>Society without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us about Contentment, Atheism and Secularity,</em> and <em>Invitation to the Sociology of Religion.</em><br><br>"Everyone knows, deep down, that there is a conflict between reason and faith-between having good reasons for what one believes and having bad ones. This conflict finds its most poignant expression in the lives of men and women who have lost their belief in God despite their best efforts to maintain it. Faith No More offers a fascinating look at these lives, and at the myriad ways in which thoughtful people can come to their senses." <br>--Sam Harris, author of the New York Times bestsellers The Moral Landscape, Letter to a Christian Nation, and The End of Faith<br><p><br>"With Faith No More Philip Zuckerman has given us a fascinating look at how individual contemporary Americans raised in various religions awakened out of a belief in the supernatural. His care in not rounding all these up into any facile overarching theories is itself almost supernatural, and yet in this careful reporting of their stories he manages to offer a great deal of insight. It is a wonderfully informative and provocative study and should be read by everyone interested in the real experience of religion and irreligion." <br>--Jennifer Michael Hecht, author of Doubt: A History<br></p><p><br>"Faith No More helps us understand the diverse routes people take to irreligiosity and the dilemmas they face in a culture that often condemns them. Far from being kneejerk atheists, it turns out that the most secular Americans have actually spent a lot of time wrestling with their faith. Documenting their journeys and placing them in sociological context, this book establishes Phil Zuckerman as one of the most sophisticated analysts of secularity today." --Arlene Stein, Professor of Sociology, Rutgers University <br></p><p><br>"This could-be-dry content proves immensely engaging becuase of Zuckerman's jargin-free exposition and his seamless incorporation of interview material rendered apparently verbatim-verbal tics("like,""you know," etc) and all-in the manner of a good documentart film."--Ray Olson, Booklist</p><p><br>"Zuckerman's writing is engaging and straightforward, which makes for enjoyable reading...[Faith No More] is laudable for its rich interview data, readability, and insight into the lived experiences of American apostates."--Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion</p><p><br>"This is an absorbing book that puts flesh on the bones of recent identifiable trends in American nonbelief and, in turn, profoundly questions the assumption of a 'spiritual turn' in Western societies. Moreover, it provides distinctive insights into the complexities of belief, nonbelief, doubt and scepticism."--Social Forces</p><p><br>"Zuckerman here builds on his previous work which examined 'Society without God, ' that is, Nordic countries which rank amongst the least religious places in the world. In this book he combines qualitative interviews and rich descriptions to produce an interesting and well written book."--CatholicBooks Review</p><p><br>"The interview data are valuable for research on irreligion in America. The book will probably be enjoyed most by readers who, like Zuckerman's subjects, have lost their religion. These readers are likely to feel encouraged that they are not alone, that it takes courage to do what they have done, and that life can be good without religion."--Sociology of Religion</p><p><br></p></p><h2>Goodnight Stories from the Quran</h2><p>Goodnight Stories from the Quran is the answer to every child&#39;s longing to hear a good bedtime story.

Harrison recounts the popular folk tales of merchants and peasants who once adopted Catholic rituals and teachings for their own purposes, only to find themselves in conflict with the orthodoxy of Franciscan missionaries arriving from Italy. The village&#x2019;s long religious history, combined with the similarities between Chinese folk religion and Italian Catholicism, forces us to rethink the extreme violence committed in the area during the Boxer Uprising. The author also follows nineteenth century Chinese priests who campaigned against missionary control, up through the founding of the official church by the Communist Party in the 1950s. Harrison&#x2019;s in-depth study provides a rare insight into villager experiences during the Socialist Education Movement and Cultural Revolution, as well as the growth of Christianity in China in recent years. She makes the compelling argument that Catholic practice in the village, rather than adopting Chinese forms in a gradual process of acculturation, has in fact become increasingly similar to those of Catholics in other parts of the world.</p><p>&#x201c;Through a brilliant analysis of Catholicism in one remote village, Harrison leads us to rethink much of the last three centuries of China&#x2019;s history. Her series of beautifully written narratives challenges not just our usual understanding of Christianity&#x2019;s reception, but the entire way we think about how local places fit into national and global networks of culture and trade.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robert P. Weller, co-author of <i>Rethinking Pluralism: Ritual, Experience and Ambiguity</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is one of the most fascinating books on Christianity in China that I have ever read. By following the history of one Catholic village over more than three hundred years, Henrietta Harrison convincingly shows how Chinese Christians sought authenticity as members of a transnational and global community.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nicolas Standaert, author of <i>The Interweaving of Rituals</i><br><br>"Harrison has written an ethnographic history that will be a model for future researchers. She has linked archival research (in the Vatican's vast collections) with on-the-spot investigations of villages in north China. None of this work is easy, but the results are spectacularly successful. This is a must read for anyone interested in Chinese social history." &#x2015;James L.

By the time he died in 1911, he was an American legend-and his Old No. 7 Tennessee sipping whiskey was an international sensation, the winner of gold medals at the St. Louis World's Fair and the Liege International Exposition in Belgium. Blood and Whiskey captures Daniel's indomitable rise in the rough-edged world of the nineteenth-century whiskey trade-and shows how his commitment to quality (his whiskey was always charcoal-filtered) and his flair for marketing and packaging (he launched his distinctive square bottle in 189-5) helped create one of America's most venerable and recognizable brands.<br> Peter Krass (Hanover, NH) is the author of Carnegie (0-471-46883-5), cited by Barron's as the "definitive" biography and selected by Library Journal as one of the best biography/business books of 2002.</p><p>The legends are colorful and many. Jack Daniel, it is said, ran away to escape a broken home; was a teenage moonshiner during the Civil War; and hauled black-market whiskey, hidden under loads of meat, to the wild river part of Huntsville, Alabama, sneaking into town after midnight to avoid the sheriff and his deputies. This is his story and how he created one of the most powerful and recognizable brands in the world.The legends are colorful and many. Jack Daniel, it is said, ran away to escape a broken home; was a teenage moonshiner during the Civil War; and hauled black-market whiskey, hidden under loads of meat, to the wild river port of Huntsville, Alabama, sneaking into town after midnight to avoid the sheriff and his deputies. Until now, however, no one has explained how this orphaned "boy distiller" went on to establish a legitimate business and create one of the most powerful and widely recognized brands in the world. <p>In Blood &amp; Whiskey, renowned biographer and business author Peter Krass digs deep into the rich history of Lynchburg, Tennessee, to discover the origins and exploits of its most famous-some say notorious-son. What he finds is an ambitious and charismatic entrepreneur who combined a love of his craft and a natural talent for marketing with far-reaching vision and a fierce determination to succeed against all odds.</p> <p>From Jack's youthful days learning the distiller's art from a former slave to his inspired design for the distinctive, square Jack Daniel's bottle, this lively biography separates fact from myth as it reveals a man whose real life was as intriguing as the tall tales told about him. It demonstrates convincingly that Jack picked the worst possible time to start his business, with the entire nation in the grip of economic depression, the federal government depending on distillers for half of its revenues, and a growing temperance movement clamoring for universal prohibition.</p> <p>Writing with a deep understanding of what it takes to build and expand a successful business, Krass explores Jack's devotion to quality, ready eye for opportunity, and willingness to take risks. These traits enabled Jack Daniel to become the most successful distiller in Tennessee, even as many of his competitors succumbed to the hardships of a hostile business environment.</p> <p>The author also uncovers the long-lost marketing secret behind the naming of Jack Daniel's flagship brand, Old No. 7, and the strategy that enabled the Jack Daniel Distillery to compete successfully against such venerable Kentucky brands as Jim Beam and Maker's Mark.</p> <p>Packed with memorable accounts of run-ins with fervent teetotalers and corrupt tax collectors, as well as heartbreaking tales of struggle and privation in post--Civil War Tennessee, Blood &amp; Whiskey tells a classic American success story with a distinctly Southern accent.</p></p><h2>The Gibson Girl and Her America: The Best Drawings of Charles Dana Gibson (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>At the turn of the twentieth century, Charles Dana Gibson's pen-and-ink drawings of the "American Girl" &#x2014; now remembered as the Gibson Girl &#x2014; became the national ideal of femininity.

Emphasizing the basic human skills that lie at the heart of effective management, it combines academic knowledge with real world practicality, the key to the book's proven durability. </p></p><p><p><b>With Whetten and Cameron's unique five-step model, learn the skills that turn <i>good ideas</i> into <i>accepted practice</i>&#x2014;and good management!</b> </p><p> Skills-based, interactive, and cross-cultural, David Whetten and Kim Cameron's newest edition of <i>Developing Management Skills</i> will help you bridge the gap between learning management skills and applying those skills to the managing job at hand. Filled with experiential exercises, examples, and the latest in technology, this book clearly focuses on the <i>skills aspect of management.</i> </p> <p> The authors present a five-step process in each chapter for assessing, learning, analyzing, practicing, and applying your own abilities to build the foundation for effective management practice. Building on your personal, interpersonal, and group skills, <i>Developing Management Skills</i> is an interactive tool based on the authors' extensive and updated research on effective managers in private and public companies. </p> <p> Here are a few of the highlights of this fifth edition: </p> <ul> <li><b>Material on nine fundamental management skills,</b> organized into three categories, to help you master the skills you'll use in managing people:</li> <ul> <li><b>Personal</b> <i>(Developing Self-Awareness; Managing Stress; Solving Problems Creatively)</i></li> <li><b>Interpersonal</b> <i>(Coaching, Counseling, and Supportive Communication; Gaining Power and Influence; Motivating Others; Managing Conflict)</i></li> <li><b>Group Skills</b> <i>(Empowering and Delegating; Building Effective Teams and Teamwork)</i></li> </ul> <li><b>New material on cross-cultural perspectives,</b> including a useful framework for comparing cultural values and providing examples of how people with different cultural values use different communication styles, influence strategies, or conflict management approaches.</li> <li><b>Three updated supplemental sections</b> on applied communications skills&#x2014;"Making Oral and Written Presentations," "Conducting Interviews," and "Conducting Meetings"&#x2014;to help prepare you for the various types of communication required of managers.</li> <li><b>NEW!

In response, each of the business disciplines is equipping their students with new tools and techniques. Accounting and operations management majors learn how computing power has given them the ability to analyze financial information that provides new insights into operational and financial performance. Finance majors learn to appreciate the latest trading techniques in derivative markets. Human resource majors are learning how to assess programs and strategize how a planned global expansion will affect an organization's human resource needs. Marketing majors learn how scanner data can be analyzed so that they can better understand customer needs and preferences. </p> <p> To complement this ever-expanding business tool kit, the objective of a management skills course is to prepare students to manage dynamic, constantly changing work environments&#x2014;the kind that challenge individuals to continually adapt by learning new methods and adopting new goals. Specifically, it prepares future managers to address questions like: "How do I get my people to accept this new approach?," "How do I explain the need to change to my `old-timers' without creating a defensive reaction?," "How do I help the `survivors' of a downsizing manage with their sense of loss, grief, and guilt?," and "How do I use existing organizational rewards to reinforce the need for change?" </p> <p> In other words, the business pressures that spawned countless waves of reengineering, six-sigma quality efforts, downsizing, and speed-to-market initiatives have also increased the need for managers with outstanding "people skills." Their unusual ability to communicate, to motivate, to make decisions, to resolve conflicts, etc., acts as a sort of "management glue" that helps organizations that are undergoing seemingly endless change from splintering apart. </p> <p> Will Rogers's dictum that "common sense ain't necessarily common practice" underscores the problem with most content-based discussions of management. It is one thing to catalogue the "best practices" associated with world-class quality, efficiency, or customer satisfactions. It is far more challenging to prepare the members of an organization to accept the need for change, to help them understand the new approach, to obtain their commitment to implement the proposal, to manage the transition period effectively, and to institutionalize the new approach by "hard wiring" it into the organization's communication, evaluation, and reward systems. As one experienced manager noted, "Good ideas are not in scarce supply. What is rare is the ability to translate a good idea into accepted practice." </p> <p> The goal of this book is to provide current and prospective managers with the personal, interpersonal, and group skills necessary to reduce the gap between good ideas and accepted practice. Managers can hire content knowledge, but they cannot hire stand-ins to represent them in critical staff meetings, conversations with angry customers, scheduling discussions with their secretaries, counseling sessions with troubled employees, or performance evaluations. Skillful performance in these settings has been documented by literally dozens of studies (see the Introduction that immediately follows this Preface) as the essential and indispensable foundation of effective management practice. </p> <p><b>Background of this Book</b></p> <p> It has been nearly two decades since we became convinced that management skills need to be a crucial part of the business school and corporate training curricula. Not only does a well-known study of business school education (Porter and McKibbin, 1988) corroborate that view, but our experience with business school students and managers in executive education seminars has continually reaffirmed our commitment to the skill development approach. </p> <p> Originally, the motivation for writing <i>Developing Management Skills</i> grew out of our frustration with teaching management courses following conventional methods. When we used texts based on the traditional "principles of management" framework, we felt uncomfortable with their lack of theoretical and research grounding. Because principles of management have been generally derived from recollections and interpretations of practicing managers, empirical research and theory regarding their validity in modern organizations is limited. </p> <p> When we used an "organization and management theory approach," students complained that the practical relevance of the material was difficult to discern. Not enough "hows" were included to be useful to students who aspired to be practicing managers. </p> <p> When we used a traditional "organizational behavior" approach, colleagues teaching the elective organizational behavior courses reported that students complained about redundancy. It became increasingly difficult to differentiate among topics covered by organizational behavior and management courses. </p> <p> When we emphasized the "experiential learning" approach, centered around simulations, case discussions, and games, students complained they weren't gaining enough substantive knowledge about how to be effective managers. Few students brought enough practical experience, theoretical knowledge, or self-analytic skills to those exercises to get much benefit from them. As a result, the exercises were entertaining but not very educational. </p> <p> After years of experimentation, we determined that while each approach had its place in the management curriculum and each could contribute to a student's education, none, taken alone, could help students develop into competent managers. </p> <p> In our search for alternatives, we asked recent graduates and senior executives to evaluate their organizational behavior and management education in terms of their experiences as managers. In general, they criticized behavioral science courses for not teaching them job-relevant skills. </p> <p> They were acutely aware of the challenges posed by "people problems" in their work, and they felt that their university education had not prepared them for that component of their job. </p> <p> Based on this feedback, we began formulating a new teaching methodology by examining how skills-based courses in education, social work, engineering, medicine, and law are taught. We also drew heavily on recent innovations in training programs for practicing managers that emphasize behavior modification through role modeling. To identify the appropriate content for a management skills course, we surveyed over 400 managers in public and private organizations and combed the professional literature for statements by management experts regarding the characteristics of effective managers. As our teaching model began to evolve, it became apparent that a supporting textbook would need to be developed. </p> <p> Early in this project it was clear that our text would be at variance with prevailing views regarding what behavioral science courses should offer management students. Typically, these courses either present an array of general principles and concepts derived from research in industrial/organizational psychology, sociology, OB, industrial administration, and so on, or they rely heavily on group exercises, games, or cases to illustrate certain management activities or functions. They either describe management practice and provide students with theories for analyzing common problems encountered by managers, or they eschew theory and research in favor of activity and involvement. Through our experience we became convinced that the strengths of each approach, used in combination, were needed for students to develop (not just know about) management skills. Therefore, the hallmark of this text is a balanced integration of theory and practice, understanding and application. </p> <p><b>A Note to Teachers</b></p> <p> Most of us are aware of a significant shift in the conversations about "good teaching" on our campuses. We are hearing less and less about improving teaching ("observe the best classroom performers and then reproduce their techniques and/or style") and more and more about improving <i>student learning</i> ("figure out what knowledge, skills, and attitudes your students need and then focus all aspects of the course on those outcomes"). </p> <p> We recently took a look at what authorities have said on the subject of student learning. Here's a sampler. </p> <p> <i>"Students learn what they care about, and remember what they understand" (Ericksen, 1984:51).</i> </p> <p> <i>"All genuine learning is active, not passive. It is a process of discovery in which the student is the main agent, not the teacher" (Adler, 1982).</i> </p> <p> <i>"Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in a class listening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences, apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves" (Chickering and Gamson, 1987:3).</i> </p> <p> Central to the increasing emphasis on student learning is the clarion call for more emphasis on "active learning." What exactly is active learning? In their classic book on this topic, Bonwell and Eison (1991) list seven characteristics of the active learning classroom (pp. 1-2): </p> <ol> <li>Students are involved in more than passive listening.</li> <li>Students are engaged in activities (e.g., reading, discussing, writing).</li> <li>There is less emphasis placed on information transmission and greater emphasis placed on developing student skills.</li> <li>There is greater emphasis placed on the exploration of attitudes and values.</li> <li>Student motivation is increased, especially in adult learners.</li> <li>Students receive immediate feedback from their instructor and peers.</li> <li>Students are involved in higher order thinking (analysis, synthesis, evaluation).</li> </ol> <p> In brief, active learning involves "learning by doing." This is a pedagogical tradition with a long and distinguished heritage. For example, in the 5th century B.C., Sophocles observed, "One must learn by doing the thing, for though you think you know it&#x2014;you have no certainty until you try." </p> <p> So why is active learning still viewed as the exception to the rule on college campuses? Bonwell and Eison (1991) list six commonly mentioned barriers to adopting this approach (pp. 5364): </p> <ol> <li>You cannot cover as much course content in the time available.</li> <li>Devising active learning strategies takes too much pre-class preparation.</li> <li>Large class size prevents implementation of active learning strategies.</li> <li>Most instructors think of themselves as being good lecturers.</li> <li>There is a lack of materials or equipment needed to support active learning approaches.</li> <li>Students often resist non-lecture approaches.</li> </ol> <p> Given this formidable set of obstacles, it is easy to understand why many professors find it difficult to fully embrace the notion of active learning in their particular university classroom. In contrast, it is gratifying to frequently receive positive reports from countless colleagues who've used the skill development approach outlined in this text to make their courses more student focused and more outcome focused. </p> <p> If you are new to this approach, we recommend that you carefully examine the five step skill development learning model described in the Introduction (immediately after the Preface), the list of teaching and learning supplements at the end of this Preface, and the suggestions for course design in Section 1 in the <i>Instructor's Manual,</i> to get a better understanding of how you can achieve the objectives of active, student-centered learning in your management course. In addition, the Prentice Hall Web site for our book (<b>www.prenhall.com/whetten</b>) contains a number of additional support tools that are worth exploring. </p> <p><b>Organization of the Material</b></p> <p> The purpose of this book is to help practicing managers and management students develop the skills necessary to cultivate and implement good ideas in organizations. Based on years of research and personal observation of effective managers, we have identified nine fundamental management skills, organized into three categories. Each chapter in this book addresses one of these skills. </p> <ul> <li><i>Personal</i><br> Developing Self-Awareness<br> Managing Personal Stress<br> Solving Problems Analytically and Creatively</li> <li><i>Interpersonal</i><br> Coaching, Counseling, and Supportive Communication<br> Gaining Power and Influence<br> Motivating Others<br> Managing Conflict</li> <li><i>Group Skills</i><br> Empowering and Delegating<br> Building Effective Teams and Teamwork</li> </ul> <p> In addition to these core skills chapters, we have included three "supplements" focusing on specific, applied communications skills: "Making Written and Oral Presentations," "Conducting Interviews," and "Conducting Meetings." </p> <p> The shift from learning management principles to developing management skills requires an associated shift in learning objectives. The goal of purely cognitive or content-oriented learning is <i>understanding.</i> In contrast, the goal of skill development is <i>application.</i> The goal of "changing my mind" is replaced with the goal of "changing my behavior." This qualitative shift in learning objectives requires an entirely new system of learning&#x2014;one that focuses less on <i>facilitating comprehension</i> and more on <i>enabling change.</i> As noted in the following table, there is a close parallel between the five step learning model used to organize the skill development process in each chapter and the widely-recognized requirements for sustainable behavioral change. </p> <p> <b>Requirements for Change</b><br> Accept the need to change<br> Understand what/how to change<br> Commit to and practice/pilot change<br> Apply and monitor change </p> <p> <b>Skill Development Steps</b><br> Skill Assessment<br> Skill Learning and Skill Analysis<br> Skill Practice<br> Skill Application </p> <p><b>Objectives for this Edition</b></p> <p> Our primary objectives in preparing this edition were to (1) bring a stronger multi-cultural perspective to the skill development process; (2) streamline and simplify the conceptual material throughout the book and significantly alter the approach used in a couple of chapters; (3) update examples, cases, and exercises; (4) continue improving the quality of the accompanying <i>Instructor's Manual;</i> and (4) make available new supplemental teaching materials. We are confident that adopters familiar with previous editions will recognize improvements in these areas. The following are some highlights of the changes you will notice in this edition: </p> <ul> <li><b>Added a multi-cultural perspective</b> - In the Self Awareness chapter we included a new section on cultural values.

Perhaps the greatest of these changes has been the formation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As a cabinet-level official, the Director oversees the various agencies of the IC and reports directly to the President. The IC today faces challenges as it never has before; everything from terrorism to pandemics to economic stability has now become an intelligence issue. As a result, the IC is shifting its focus to a world in which tech-savvy domestic and international terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, failing states, and economic instability are now a way of life.</p> <p></p><strong> </strong><p><strong>Introduction to Intelligence Studies</strong> provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence and security issues, defining critical terms, and reviewing the history of intelligence as practiced in the United States. Designed in a practical sequence, the book begins with the basics of intelligence, progresses through its history, describes best practices, and explores the way the IC looks and operates today. Each chapter begins with objectives and key terms and closes with questions to test reader assimilation.</p> <p></p> <p>The authors examine the "pillars" of the American intelligence system&#x2015;collection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert operations&#x2015;and demonstrate how these work together to provide "decision advantage." The book provides equal treatment to the functions of the intelligence world&#x2015;balancing coverage on intelligence collection, counterintelligence, information management, critical thinking, and decision-making. It also covers such vital issues as laws and ethics, writing and briefing for the IC, and the emerging threats and challenges that intelligence professionals will face in the future.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><strong>Carl J.

This is not an original question, but in this book it is given an original and challenging answer. Paul Cartledge examines the Greeks in terms of their own self-image, mainly as it was presented by the supposedly objective historians: Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenephon. The Greeks were the inventors of history as we understand it, just as they were our cultural ancestors in so many other ways. Yet their historiography remained rooted in myth, and the mental and material context of many of the inventions for which we rightly treasure the Greek achievement--especially democracy, philosophy, and theater, as well as history--was often deeply alien to our own ways of thinking and acting. The aim of <em>The Greeks</em> is to explore that achievement. The book looks in depth at how the dominant Greeks--adult, male, citizen--sought, with limited success, to define themselves unambiguously in polar opposition to a whole series of "others"--non-Greeks, women, non-citizens, slaves, and gods.</p><p><br><strong>Paul Cartledge</strong> is Reader in Greek History at the University of Cambridge.

It will help families create and administer a culture that recognizes trusts as a gift of love.</p> <p>Marrying the practical and emotional aspects of family wealth, this book provides a hands-on primer that focuses on fostering positive relationships, and structuring the trust appropriately for the situation and the people involved. It tackles difficult topics with frank and honest discussion, from the first beneficiary meeting to working with addictions, and more. Written by a team of experts in family wealth, this information is becoming increasingly crucial to the successful execution of a trust; you'll learn what type of person makes the best trustee, how to be an excellent beneficiary, and the technical aspects that help you build a better trust from the very beginning.</p> <p>There's been a staggering increase in trustee/beneficiary litigation and hostility, but that doesn't mean it's inevitable. Plenty of trusts are running smoothly, with positive experiences on all sides. This book shows you how to set up your trust to succeed from the start, with step-by-step guidance and expert insight.</p> <ul> <li>Express clear and thoughtful intent for the trust</li> <li>Create a healthy and supportive culture</li> <li>Select the right trustee, trust protector, and trust advisor</li> <li>Take the time to prepare before initially meeting the beneficiary</li> <li>Conduct a productive first meeting to set a tone for the relationship</li> </ul> <p>Historically, there has been little consideration given to the culture of trusts, and this oversight may be a key driver of the behavior that's becoming more prevalent. <i>Family Trusts</i> explores the nature of these relationships, and shows you how to build a trust that retains the nature and spirit with which it was intended.</p></p><p><p>A trust is a not a document or a receptacle. It is a relationship, aimed at benefiting someone's life. Why, then, do 80 percent of trust beneficiaries view their trusts as burdens and not blessings? The authors believe that lack of attention to the human realities of trusts is to blame. <i>Family Trusts </i>challenges the disappointing status quo with new recommendations for building trusts that preserve the hopes of their creators and support the dreams of their beneficiaries. </p><p>Most trusts are formed to save taxes, protect against creditors, and exert control over property. As important as these largely quantitative goals are, they ignore and often impede trusts' qualitative possibilities. This revolutionary guide lays out sound practices for trustees, trust protectors, and trust creators to develop flourishing beneficiaries. It shows trustees how to manage their fiduciary risks by taking concrete steps to get to know beneficiaries and address their concerns. It also opens the eyes of beneficiaries and trust creators to the higher purpose that trusts can achieve, where dynamic distributions promote beneficiary growth and independence rather than perpetuate a "trust-fund baby" distribution-dependency. Whether your trust is already established or you're planning to create trusts, this deeply practical guide shows you how to: </p><ul> <li>Communicate clearly and effectively with beneficiaries at various stages of their development and at various stages in the trust's own life</li> <li>Make prudent distributions to promote beneficiaries' growth</li> <li>Thoughtfully prepare for the creation of new trusts or the termination of old ones</li> <li>Restructure the roles of trustee and trust protector to manage risk and reduce the likelihood of conflict</li> </ul> <p>Wherever you are in the trustscape, you can have a more rewarding experience with <i>Family Trusts</i>.</p><p>"The Anglo-American trust is an ancient principles-based regime that will survive into the 21st century only so long as it is administered by persons of principle.

There in bedsits and cafes he found a world of brutality and comedy, of shortlived jobs and precarious relationships. All of which he faced with humour and intelligence.</p><p>&#34;As soon as I stepped out of my mother&#39;s womb...I realized that I had made a mistake&#34;, Quentin Crisp declares, giving a small hint of the witty and wry approach he takes toward the life he describes with uninhibited exuberance in this classic autobiography, which is both a comic masterpiece and a unique testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Crisp not only came out as a gay man in 1931, when the slightest sign of homosexuality shocked public sensibilities, but he did so with grand and provocative flamboyance, determined to spread the message that homosexuality did not exclude him or anyone else from the human race. His hilarious descriptions of encounters with parents, friends, employers, soldiers and sailors, and the law reveal the strength and humor of an honest man, determined to face the world with the uncensored, unapologetic truth about himself.<b>Quentin Crisp</b> was born on Christmas Day 1908 in Sutton, a suburb of London. After leaving school he became an illustrator and a designer of book covers before spending the next 35 years of his life as an artists' model. In 1981 he moved to New York City and became a resident alien, living in a one bedroom flat in Chelsea which he famously never cleaned ("After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse"), and describing himself as a "resident waif." He died in 1999, just one month short of his 91st birthday.</p><h2>Experiences from the Threshold and Beyond: Understood through Anthroposophy</h2><p><p>&#x201c;There is a physical world, which we all accept as real, but there is also a spiritual world that interpenetrates this material world and is its cause and foundation. Between these two worlds exists a threshold that can be felt, seen clairvoyantly, traversed and passed through by anyone with a real desire to do so..... At this threshold there is a guardian whose task is to stop humans from passing across it unprepared.&#x201d; (from the introduction)<br></p><p>Based on first-hand knowledge, Are Thoresen offers insights into the meaning of the threshold to the spiritual world. He describes his own experiences in encountering this threshold and going beyond it. But there are many thresholds to the spiritual world, he says, and many ways to pass them&#x2015;as there are many aspects to the &#x201c;guardian of the threshold&#x201d; and versions of the so-called animals at the threshold. The worlds beyond, too, have a variety of different constructions&#x2015;or, as the Bible says, &#x201c;In my Father&#x2019;s house are many mansions.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>The author describes the methods and techniques for opening the spiritual sense organs required to cross the threshold, and clarifies the differences between Imagination (seeing spiritual &#x201c;pictures&#x201d;), Inspiration (understanding those pictures) and Intuition (living &#x201c;inside&#x201d; the spiritual reality). Structuring the book on his own biography, Thoresen conveys many of the lessons he has learned through decades of familiarity with the invisible dimensions. However, he warns that there is only one good reason to attempt to cross the threshold, and that is to serve God and humanity in the name of love. If we do it out of curiosity, or to enhance our personal development, it would be better not to try.</p></p><p><b>Are Thoresen</b>&nbsp;was born in Norway in 1952. A doctor of veterinary medicine, he has also studied anthroposophic medicine, homeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy and agriculture. Since 1981 he has run a private holistic practice in Sandefjord, Norway, for the healing of small animals and horses, as well as people. He has lectured widely, specializing in veterinary acupuncture, and has published dozens of scholarly articles. In 1984 he started to treat cancer patients, both human and animals, and this work has been the focus of much of his recent research. He is the author of <i>Demons and Healing</i>&nbsp;and several other books on complementary medicine published in various languages.</p><h2>Becoming Influential: A Guide for Nurses</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This groundbreaking book applies a practical approach toward becoming a professional nurse with exemplary influence skills.

This beautifully designed treasury gathers his most beloved tales in a gilt-stamped, hardcover edition, illustrated with 28 full-color images by Golden Age artist Edmund Dulac. Filled with such favorites as &#34;The Snow Queen,&#34; &#34;The Nightingale,&#34; and &#34;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes,&#34; this masterful collection will excite the senses of book lovers everywhere.</p><p>"Adults and children alike need the actual Andersen, here made brilliantly available by the Franks." --Harold Bloom, editor of Stories and Poems for Extremely Intelligent Children of All Ages.<br><br>"This is the real Andersen, restored to life, in the flavor of Danish. . .here at last you will find him." --Garrison Keillor<br><br>"The Franks" edition finally sets the stories straight and . . . clarifies the tale most often told wrong--Andersen"s own life story." --Elise Soukup<br><br>"[The Franks] have stripped away the florid Victorianism of the previous translations...[and] have widened the scope of Andersen's oeuvre." --Heather Caldwell, Bookforum<br><br>"The Franks' edition finally sets the stories straight and . . . clarifies the tale most often told wrong--Andersen's own life story." --Elise Soukup<br><br>"�The Franks� have stripped away the florid Victorianism of the previous translations...�and� have widened the scope of Andersen's oeuvre." --Heather Caldwell, Bookforum<br><br>"The Franks' edition finally sets the stories straight and . . . clarifies the tale most often told wrong-- Andersen' s own life story." --Elise Soukup<br><br>"The Franks&amp; #39; edition finally sets the stories straight and . . . clarifies the tale most often told wrong&amp; mdash; Andersen&amp; #39; s own life story." --Elise Soukup<br><br>"A superb book of Andersen's tales . . . it will be difficult for other commemorative editions to match this publication." --Jack ZipesGrade 2-4-Matthews has simplified the story lines and modernized the language of 11 familiar Andersen tales. His style is conversational and lively, and he avoids the use of slang. Snow's cartoon illustrations create a feeling of bumptious good humor and are well integrated throughout the text, varying from small pictures in the middle of a page, to full-page spreads. This lighthearted approach of both text and pictures is somewhat at odds with the irony and tragedy of tales such as "The Pig Boy," "The Little Mermaid," and "The Steadfast Tin Soldier." It works best with the more amusing "Princess and the Pea" and "The Emperor's New Clothes." Unfortunately, the emperor is shown on the cover, the title page, and in the book wearing boxer shorts, though he is referred to as naked, a minor distortion, yet one that stands out. In condensing the tales, the layers of meaning and emotion in the originals are lost. Still, Matthew's edition, with its large clear type and generous margins, is open and inviting. It will attract young readers to the tales, and it does provide a serviceable first reading of the familiar classics.<br><i>Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Basic Refrigeration: Principles, Practice, Operation (Book&amp;Graphs)</h2><p>king book for first class refrigeration license test</p><p></p><h2>Bringing STEM to the Elementary Classroom - PB413X</h2><p>Many resources help you encourage young children to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

This book details how two distinguished physicists and Nobel laureates have explored this theme in two lectures given in Cambridge, England, in 1986 to commemorate the famous British physicist Paul Dirac. Given for nonspecialists and undergraduates, the talks transcribed in Elementary Particles and the Laws of Physics focus on the fundamental problems of physics and the present state of our knowledge. Professor Feynman examines the nature of antiparticles, and in particular the relationship between quantum spin and statistics. Professor Weinberg speculates on how Einstein&#39;s theory of gravitation might be reconciled with quantum theory in the final law of physics. Highly accessible, deeply thought provoking, this book will appeal to all those interested in the development of modern physics.</p><p>Perhaps the two most important conceptual breakthroughs in twentieth century physics are relativity and quantum mechanics.

At the height of their power in the late eleventh century, the Chaco Anasazi dominated a territory in the American Southwest larger than any European principality of the time. A vast and powerful alliance of thousands of farming hamlets and nearly 100 spectacular towns integrated the region through economic and religious ties, and the whole system was interconnected with hundreds of miles of roads.

It took these Anasazi farmers more than seven centuries to create classic Chacoan civilization, which lasted some 200 years -- only to collapse spectacularly in a mere 40.<p>Why did such a great society collapse? Who survived? Why? In this lively book anthropologist/archaeologist David Stuart presents answers to these questions that offer useful lessons to modern societies. His account of the rise and fall of the Chaco Anasazi brings to life the people who are known to us today as the architects of Chaco Canyon, now a spectacular national park in northwestern New Mexico.</p><p>Chaco's failure, Stuart argues, was a failure to adapt to the consequences of rapid growth. Foremost among Chacoans' problems were misuse of farmland, malnutrition, loss of community, and inability to deal with climatic catastrophe. The descendants of the Anasazi, the Pueblo Indians of the Southwest, adapted strategically to minimize the impact of these problems. Stuart sees the contrasting fates of the Anasazi and their Pueblo descendants as a parable for modern societies.</p>Describes the rise and 12th century demise of New Mexico&#39;s Chaco Anasazi--uncontrolled growth and separation into &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have nots&#34; were their undoing. Modern industrial society has much to learn from this compelling saga of failure, adjustment, and redemption.</p><h2>Counting Sheep: From Open Range to Agribusiness on the Columbia Plateau</h2><p>First Edition, 1989, first printing, a new, unread, unworn, unopened, unmarked trade softover, from Washington.

Now, in this collection of essays by and about those writers who shared the energetic early years, Robert Dana presents a dynamic, informative tribute to Engle and his world.</p> <p>The book's three sections mingle myth and history with style and grace and no small amount of humor. The beginning essays are given over to memories of Paul Engle in his heyday. The second group focuses particularly on those teachers&#x2014;Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Kurt Vonnegut, for example&#x2014;who made the workshop hum on a day-to-day basis. Finally, the third section is devoted to storytelling: tall tales, vignettes, surprises, sober and not-so-sober moments. Engle's own essay, "The Writer and the Place," describes his "simple, and yet how reckless" conviction that "the creative imagination in all of the arts is as important, as congenial, and as necessary, as the historical study of all the arts."</p> <p>Today, of course, there are hundreds of writers' workshops, many of them founded and directed by graduates of the original Iowa workshop. But when Paul Engle arrived in Iowa there were exactly two. His indomitable nature and great persuasive powers, combined with his distinguished reputation as a poet, loomed large behind the enhancement of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. This volume of fine and witty essays reveals the enthusiasm and drive and sheer pleasure that went into Iowa's renowned workshop.</p> <p></p></p><p><i>A Community of Writers</i> is an utterly engaging tribute to the early, Paul Engle days of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Iowa's first creative writing course was offered as early as 1896, and Norman Foerster gave Iowa's creative writing program a push in the 1930s. But it was Paul Engle, who took over the workshop in 1943, "with his indefatigable drive, entrepreneurial skill, and boyish enthusiasm," John C. Gerber writes here, "who brought the workshop its fame and international attention." Creative writing, says Philip Levine, is "one of the most amazing growth industries we have," but in those days, there was just Iowa. And Iowa was Paul Engle, some corrugated steel barracks (miserable in the heat, deafening during a rainstorm), and an ever-changing cast of exceptionally talented writers.<p> For <i>A Community of Writers</i>, 30 writers--including Donald Justice, Robert Bly, Marvin Bell, and Bharati Mukherjee--bring to life Engle, the other instructors, and some rollicking good (and bad) times in Iowa City. While W. D. Snodgrass claims that "almost no one was disappointed by [Robert] Lowell's teaching," Levine claims that "to say I was disappointed in Lowell as a teacher is an understatement.... A teacher who is visibly bored by his students and their poems is hard to admire"; especially when those students included two future Pulitzer Prize winners, one Yale winner, one National Book Critics Circle Award winner, three Lamont Prize winners, and one America Book Award winner. Lowell, John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Dylan Thomas, and many other extraordinary writers-instructors weave their way in and out of these stories, but none so much as Engle. "Paul Engle should get a posthumous medal from the Coast Guard for all the lives he saved," says Kurt Vonnegut. "No writer in all of history did as much to help other writers." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Robert Dana's most recent books of poetry are <i>Hello, Stranger</i> and <i>Yes, Everything</i>. He graduated in 1954 from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. After forty years of teaching at Cornell College, he retired in 1994 as professor of English and poet-in-residence. His work was awarded National Endowment fellowships in 1985 and 1993, the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Poetry Award in 1989, and a Pushcart Prize in 1996.</p><h2>The Architects and the City: Holabird &amp; Roche of Chicago, 1880-1918 (Chicago Architecture and Urbanism)</h2><p>Winner of the&nbsp;1998 Spiro Kostof Book Award from the Society of Architectural Historians. <br><br>Chicago has always held a special fascination for those interested in architectural and urban history. For many, the defining moment occurred at the turn of the century when Chicago was booming and the world came to the city by the lake. But the story most often told in architectural history&#x2014;the tale of single creative geniuses like Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan&#x2014;does little to explain the birth of the everyday modern city, with its high-rise downtown, diverse neighborhoods, and sprawling suburbs. This book connects architectural history with urban history by looking at the work of a major architectural firm, Holabird &amp; Roche. No firm in any large American city had a greater impact.<br><br>With projects that ranged from tombstones to skyscrapers, boiler rooms to entire industrial complexes, Holabird &amp; Roche left an indelible stamp on the city of Chicago and, indeed, far beyond. In this volume, the first of two on Holabird &amp; Roche and its successor, Holabird &amp; Root, Robert Bruegmann traces the firm&#x2019;s history from its founding in 1880 to the end of the First World War. Incorporating meticulous research based on the extensive architectural holdings of the Chicago Historical Society, Bruegmann documents the firm&#x2019;s work from the boom years of the 1880s through the period of sustained growth and innovation after the turn of the century. In chapters devoted to topics as diverse as downtown commercial and retail development, business hotels, civic buildings, automobile showrooms, and suburban clubs and housing, Bruegmann creates a sustained historical narrative that considers the profound interdependence of architecture and modern urban life.</p><p></p><h2>Managing For Dummies</h2><p>Being a manager can be an intimidating and challenging task.

Allentown has seen a noticeable rebound over the course of the past twenty years. Facing a collapse of its steel-making firms, its economy has reinvented itself by transforming existing companies, building an entrepreneurial sector, and attracting inward investment. Youngstown was similar to Allentown in its industrial history, the composition of its labor force, and other important variables, and yet instead of adapting in the face of acute economic crisis, it fell into a mean race to the bottom.<br>Challenging various theoretical perspectives on regional socioeconomic change, <i>Why the Garden Club Couldn&#x2019;t Save Youngstown</i> argues that the structure of social networks among the cities&#x2019; economic, political, and civic leaders account for the divergent trajectories of post-industrial regions. It offers a probing historical explanation for the decline, fall, and unlikely rejuvenation of the Rust Belt. Emphasizing the power of social networks to shape action, determine access to and control over information and resources, define the contexts in which problems are viewed, and enable collective action in the face of externally generated crises, this book points toward present-day policy prescriptions for the ongoing plight of mature industrial regions in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Sean Safford is Visiting Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.&#x201c;An innovative work of scholarship, in method, phenomenon, and theory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gerald McDermott, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating study of the determinants of regional competitiveness in the U.S., <i>Why the Garden Club Couldn't Save Youngstown</i> has important lessons for scholars and policymakers interested in economic adaptation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>AnnaLee Saxenian, author of <i>New Argonauts: Regional Advantage in the Global Economy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Safford's work represents a clear advance in understanding the importance of networks for industrial and community development.

Today Italians consider Pinocchio, along with <i>The Divine Comedy</i> and <i>The Decameron</i>, one of their most important works of literature. Collodi did more than merely weave a captivating tale. Through metaphor and allusion he summed up the national character of Italy and made biting commentary on many of the prominent social concerns of the nineteenth century, among them the despair and hunger of poverty, the importance of an education, and the hypocrisy of the judicial and medical establishments. Indeed, the universality of Collodi&#x2019;s themes led Benedetto Croce to remark, &#x201c;The wood from which Pinocchio is carved is humanity itself.&#x201d; This vibrant new translation fully renders Collodi&#x2019;s subtle and sarcastic wit, reclaiming the book for adult readers.

Part I develops a general theory for making treatment and care decisions for patients who are not competent to decide for themselves. It provides an in-depth analysis of competence, articulates and defends a coherent set of principles to specify suitable surrogate decisionmakers and to guide their choices, examines the value of advance directives, and investigates the role that considerations of cost ought to play in decisions concerning incompetents. Part II applies this theoretical framework to the distinctive problems of three important classes of individuals, many of whom are incompetent: minors, the elderly, and psychiatric patients. The authors&#39; approach combines a probing analysis of fundamental issues in ethical theory with a sensitive awareness of the concrete realities of health care institutions and the highly personal and individual character of difficult practical problems. Its broad scope will appeal to health professionals, moral philosophers and lawyers alike.</p><p>A probing analysis of fundamental issues in ethical theory attempts to equate an awareness of the realities of health care institutions with the dilemmas of making decisions for those who are incapable of making their own."Few problems in medicine so puzzle and pain families, healthcare workers, and officials as much as those about making decisions for incompetent people. Allen Buchanan and Dan Brock have made a signal, and major, contribution to the analysis of such issues. They have, first of all, contributed an elegant and thoughtful theory, and then they have moved, second, from the theoretical to the practical realm, trying to spell out how in practice the incompetent might best be respected and treated. This book will have a central and enduring place in future discussion, pertinent not only to those interested in the theoretical questions, but to those charged with actually caring for, and deciding for, the incompetent. It will help illuminate a problem that seems both intractable and painful. That is a giant contribution." Daniel Buchanan, Director of the Hastings Center<br><br>"Buchanan and Brock's treatment of surrogate decision making is an outstanding example of the type of scholarship which the field [of bioethics] needs. The combination of its intellectual virtues with its comprehensiveness of treatment will make this book the standard work on this important topic for years to come." Baruch A. Brody, Baylor College of Medicine<br><br>"Buchanan and Brock's special contribution is to bring systematic moral reasoning and consideration of social and institutional practices to bear on a spectrum of questions related to incompetence. The result is a subtle, selective, and philosophically sophisticated work." Hastings Center Report<br><br>"Deciding for Others addresses an important issue with wide-ranging implications for health care and will undoubtedly become a work of major significance." Dermot K. Feenan, Journal of Health, Politics, Policy and Law<br><br>"This excellent and challenging book discusses virtually the whole range of ethical questions that arise when medical decisions must be made by someone other than the patient....Buchanan and Brock's invigorating treatment will remain a key point of departure for anyone who wants to better understand the ethics of treatment refusal." Medical Humanities Review<br><br>"From such a pair one would expect a landmark, and one is not disappointed." Jonathan D. Moreno, Ethics<br><br>"Deciding for Others has much to teach the general reader who may have read press coverage of major court descisions such as Cruzan. It also makes an enormous contribution to current scholarly debates regarding surrogate decision making in medicine, law, and ethics. Brock and Buchanan move present debates forward by leaps and bounds." Uriel Barzal</p><h2>Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking (6th Edition)</h2><p>This book helps readers bridge the gap between simply memorizing or blindly accepting information and the greater challenge of critical analysis and synthesis. It teaches them to respond to alternative points of view and develop a solid foundation for making personal choices about what to accept and what to reject as they read and listen. Chapter titles include: The Benefit of Asking the Right Questions; What are the Issue and the Conclusion?; What Are the Reasons?; What Are the Value Conflicts and Assumptions?; Are There Any Fallacies in the Reasoning?; How Good Is the Evidence: Intuition, Appeals to Authority, and Testimonials?; and What Reasonable Conclusions Are Possible?. For any critical reader who wants to enhance and develop better reasoning skills in order to make rational decisions.</p><p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> The success of previous editions of this book is potent testimony to our collective curiosity about what to believe. Our minds are under assault by experts and scam artists alike. Sorting among all their claims about what to eat, do, and believe is an incredibly difficult responsibility. We know that we need all the help we can get to protect ourselves from the dangers implicit in nonsense. It is in that spirit of watchful curiosity that we join with our readers in using this sixth edition of <i>Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking.</i> </p> <p> The sixth edition builds on the advice of hundreds of readers, many of whom care enough about the book and critical thinking to suggest how we could "do it better." The tone of their comments almost always reflects their general satisfaction with the approach, while suggesting a tweaking here and there that, they believe, would make the book even more useful. We have attempted to be attentive to as many of these suggestions as we could, while maintaining the strengths of earlier editions. Individual readers who do not see their suggestions included will surely understand that writing for a general audience requires us to omit many valuable components that we would include were we writing for a more specialized group of readers. </p> <p> Thus, like its predecessors, this sixth edition is much more a joint work than the title page suggests. It is increasingly difficult for us to determine where our contributions end and where those of our readers begin. We hope that this edition reflects any wisdom that may have been lurking in former editions, while taking advantage of fresh insights gleaned from our own teaching and the caring suggestions of others. </p> <p> Like this edition of <i>Asking the Right Questions,</i> critical thinking is both old and new. Systematic evaluation of arguments based on explicit rational criteria is as old as recorded history. Terminology changes, emphases emerge, and worthwhile disputes about the criteria for rational conversation break out. But the habit of questioning the quality of the reasoning for a belief or contention is implicit in our daily living. </p> <p> Certainly, individuals may not be particularly skilled at this questioning process, but it is hard to imagine what it would mean to always and ever accept as true whatever we hear. Critical thinking thus has staying power. All of us can be confident that the interest in critical thinking will outlive us. So this book is part of a very old, yet enduring, tradition. Our interest in critical thinking ties us together in an important respect: We want to think carefully before we make a belief our own. </p> <p> From the start of this book's history, we have been motivated by our personal experiences and observations. First, we have been dismayed by the degree to which students and citizens in general increasingly depend on "experts," textbook writers, teachers, lawyers, politicians, journalists, and TV commentators. As the complexity of the world seems to increase at an accelerating rate, there is a greater tendency to become passive absorbers of information, uncritically accepting what we see and hear. We are concerned that too many of us are not actively making personal choices about what to accept and what to reject. </p> <p> Thus, the need for such a book is now even more pronounced. The use of "sound bites," the popularity of simplistic arguments, and the amount of information to which we are exposed every day have all increased dramatically. To encourage us all to use critical thinking more frequently as an antidote to this "information explosion" is our dream for <i>Asking the Right Questions.</i> </p> <p> Our experience in teaching critical-thinking skills to our students over a number of years has convinced us that when individuals with diverse abilities are taught these skills in a simplified format, they can learn to apply them successfully. In the process, they develop greater confidence in their ability to make rational choices about social issues, even those with which they have formerly had little experience. </p> <p> Another motivating factor for the book has been our inability to find materials with which to teach the skills we wanted students to learn. We did not want a philosophy text, but rather a book that, while informal in nature, would outline basic critical-thinking skills explicitly, concisely, and simply. We did not find such a book. </p> <p> Thus, we have written a text that does a number of things that other books have failed to do. This text develops an integrated series of question-asking skills that can be applied widely. These skills are discussed in an informal style. (We have written to a general audience, not to any specialized group.) </p> <p> The development of <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> has leaned heavily on our joint experience of sixty years as teachers of critical thinking. Our ideas have evolved in response to numerous classroom experiences with students at many different levels, from freshman to Ph.D. students. </p> <p> These experiences have taught us certain emphases that are particularly effective in learning critical thinking. For example, we provide many opportunities for readers to apply their skills and to receive immediate feedback following the practice application. The book is replete with examples of writing devoted to controversial contemporary topics. The breadth of topics introduces the average reader to numerous controversies with which he or she may have little familiarity. The book is coherently organized, in that critical questions are discussed sequentially as the reader progresses from understanding to evaluating. In addition, it integrates cognitive and value dimensions&#x2014;a very important aspect of critical thinking and personal decision making. </p> <p> One feature that deserves to be highlighted is the applicability of <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> to numerous life experiences extending far beyond the classroom. The habits and attitudes associated with critical thinking are transferable to consumer, medical, legal, and general ethical choices. When our surgeon says surgery is needed, it can be life sustaining to seek answers to critical questions. </p> <p> To make this general applicability apparent and to provide an element of cohesiveness to the book, each chapter begins with brief exchanges concerning the desirability of capital punishment. We all care about this issue, and critical thinking enables us to express our concerns in a more reasonable fashion. The exchange should be read both before and after the applicable chapter. It is our hope that the second reading will be more satisfying. </p> <p> In addition, the sixth edition includes the following new features: </p> <ol> <li>Creation of a Web site with additional practice passages. This addition is our response to the most oft-repeated request from current readers.</li> <li>Completely revised comprehensive example of the critical questions at work in Chapter 14.</li> <li>Inclusion of hints for using the critical thinking questions as an aid to writing and speaking.</li> <li>Revision of almost half of the practice passages to reflect changing student interests.</li> <li>Highlighting of those chapter sections that explain how to use the critical questions to evaluate arguments.</li> <li>Inclusion of end-of-chapter Internet practice opportunities.</li> <li>Addition of a "Final Word" emphasizing the need to use critical thinking skills in a constructive manner.</li> </ol> <p> Each new element has emerged from the teaching experience of numerous colleagues. </p> <p> Who would find <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> especially beneficial? Because of our teaching experiences with readers representing many levels of ability, we have difficulty envisioning any academic course or program for which this book would not be useful. In fact, the first five editions have been used in law, English, pharmacy, philosophy, education, psychology, sociology, religion, and social science courses, as well as in numerous high school classrooms. </p> <p> A few uses for the book seem especially appropriate. Teachers in general education programs may want to begin their courses by assigning it as a coherent response to their students' requests to explain what is expected of them. English courses that emphasize expository writing could use this text both as a format for evaluating arguments prior to constructing an essay and as a checklist of problems that the writer should attempt to avoid as he or she writes. The book is especially functional in courses for training prospective teachers and graduate assistants because it makes explicit much that teachers will want to encourage in their students. Supplementing their current content with our step-by-step description of the process of critical reading and thinking may enrich courses in study-skill development. The text can also be used as the central focus of courses designed specifically to teach critical reading and thinking skills. </p> <p> While <i>Asking the Right Questions</i> stems primarily from our classroom experiences, it is written so that it can guide the reading and listening habits of almost everyone. The skills that it seeks to develop are those that any critical reader needs in order for reading to serve as a basis for rational decisions. The critical questions stressed in the book can enhance anyone's reasoning, regardless of the extent of his or her formal education. </p> <p> This sixth edition owes special debts to many people. Many readers of earlier editions have cared enough about this project to suggest improvements. Several have been especially helpful. Carrie Williamson has made numerous contributions to this edition. Her continued success as a learner is the type of legacy that this book hopes to facilitate in some small way. As always, Andrea Giampetro-Meyer of Loyola College in Baltimore has provided us with much dependable advice. We also wish to acknowledge the following Prentice Hall reviewers: Brian Allan Wooters, Metropolitan Community College; Naomi Werne, Wichita State University; and Valeri Farmer-Dougan, Illinois State University. </p> <p> While our students are always a major source of suggested improvements, a few distinguished themselves in that regard. The sixth edition depended heavily on improvements suggested by Kathleen Maloy, Amanda Sanford, Justin Esarey, Kari Freeman, and Elizabeth Barre. </p> <p> M. Neil Browne<br> Stuart M.

He is perceived through his best-known book, <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, as the founder of economics as a science, and his ideas about the free market and the role of the state (in relation to it) continue to influence modern economic thought. Yet Smith achieved even more as a man of letters, as a moralist, historian, and critic.<br> <em>The Life of Adam Smith</em>, the first full-scale biography of Smith in a hundred years, is a superb account of Smith's life and work, encompassing a career that spanned some of the defining moments in world history, including the American and French Revolutions. Here author Ian Simpson Ross examines Smith's family life, education, career, intellectual circle (including David Hume and Francois Quesnay), and his contemporaries (the likes of Immanuel Kant, Voltaire, and Thomas Jefferson), bringing to life this great thinker and author. Readers will meet Smith as a student at a lively Glasgow University and at a sleepy Oxford; a freelance lecturer delivering popular classes on rhetoric; an innovative university teacher ("by far the most useful, and therefore," Smith wrote, "by far the happiest and most honourable period of my life"); then a tutor travelling abroad with a Duke; an acclaimed political economist; a policy advisor to governments during and after the American Revolution; and finally, if paradoxically in view of his strongly held tenets, a Commissioner of Customs coping with free traders in the smuggling business. But it his impact as a writer that continues to set Adam Smith apart today. <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, published in 1776, as the British Parliament was deep in debate about the American colonies, continues to influence modern economic theory throughout the world. Ross sheds new light on this classic work and on its meaning for today. And he also paints a vivid portrait of Smith's personal life, revealing a man of singular generosity of spirit, who believed that with wit and logic and sensitivity to our feelings, we might aspire to virtue rather than wealth, and so become members of a truly civil society.<br> Upon Adam Smith's death in 1790, a friend wrote of him, "Happy are those who at the close of life can reflect that they have lived to a valuable purpose by contributing, as he did, to enlighten mankind, and to spread the blessings of peace and liberty and virtue." <em>The Life of Adam Smith</em> illuminates the world of a man whose legacy of thought concerns and affects us all.</p><p>In this, the first full-scale biography of Adam Smith for a hundred years, Ian Simpson Ross brings his subject into historical light as a thinker and author by examining his family circumstance, education, career, and social and intellectual circle, including David Hume and Francois Quesnay. Smith&#39;s life is revealed through his correspondence, archival documents, the reports of contemporaries, and the record of his publications. This is the life of a Scottish moral philosopher whose legacy of thought concerns and affects us all. Its lively and informed account will appeal to those interested in the social and intellectual milieu of the eighteenth century, and in Scottish history. Economists and philosophers will find much to read about the history of their disciplines, supported by full documentation.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Ian Simpson Ross</strong> is Emeritus Professor of English at the University of British Columbia.

Charles Wright&#39;s translation, Jonathan Galassi&#39;s introduction, and, as afterword, Montale&#39;s thoughtful essay on Campana, identify the heart of this poet&#39;s achievement.</p><p>In his brief life, Dino Campana (1885-1932) produced some of the most radical and pure moments of modern Italian literature. His work is comparable in some ways to what Rimbaud is for the French or Hart Crane for American poetry. The leading American poet Charles Wright, his translator, has won the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, among other honors.Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Understanding Immigration Law</h2><p><i>Understanding Immigration Law</i> lays out the basics of U.S. immigration law in an accessible way to newcomers to the field.

Reviewing the entire output of the key glasnost outlets in 1987-1991, he elucidates and documents key themes in this national soul-searching and the &#x201c;ultimate&#x201d; questions that sparked moral awakening of a great nation: &#x201c;Who are we? How do we live honorably? What is a dignified relationship between man and state? How do we atone for the moral breakdown of Stalinism?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Contributing both to the theory of revolutions and history of ideas, Aron presents a thorough and original narrative about new ideas&#x2019; dissemination through the various media of the former Soviet Union.

Now, in <em>Gabriel's Palace</em>, scholar Howard Schwartz has collected the greatest of these stories, sacred and secular, in a marvelously readable anthology.<br> <em>Gabriel's Palace</em> offers a treasury of 150 pithy and powerful tales, involving experiences of union with the divine, out-of-body travel, encounters with angels and demons, possession by spirits holy and pernicious, and more. Schwartz provides an informative introduction placing these remarkable tales firmly in the context of centuries of post-biblical Jewish tradition. The body of the text presents spellbinding tales from the Talmud, Zohar, the Hasidic masters, and an enormous range of other sources. Here are stories of Shimon bar Yohai, reputed to be the author of the Zohar; Isaac Luria, known as the Ari, who was the central figure among the Safed mystics of the 16th century; Israel ben Eliezer, known as Baal Shem Tov, who founded Hasidism; Elimelech of Lizensk, possessor of legendary mystical powers; and Nachman of Bratslav, the great storyteller whose wandering spirit is said to protect his followers to this day. Together, these tales paint a vivid picture of "a world of signs and symbols, where everything that took place had meaning, a world of mythic proportions....A world in which the spirits of the dead were no longer invisible, nor the angels," where the master and his disciples labor to repair the world so that the footsteps of the Messiah might be heard.<br> Drawn from rabbinic, kabbalistic, folk, and Hasidic sources, these collected tales form a rich genre all their own. In <em>Gabriel's Palace</em>, the powerful tradition of Jewish mysticism comes to life in clear, contemporary English.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Schwartz</strong> is Professor of English Literature at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.

He has also edited the anthologies <em>Gates to the New City: A Treasury of Modern Jewish Tales</em>, <em>Voices Within the Ark: The Modern Jewish Poets</em>, and <em>Imperial Messages: 100 Modern Parables</em>.<br>"There are 80 pages of scholarly notes about the tales, and an extremely helpful Glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish words."--The Living Church<br><br>"Gabriel's Palace offers tales on such intriguing topics as meditation and spiritual growth, psychic phenomena like clairvoyance and precognition, dreamwork, healing, near-death and out-of-the-body experiences, and potent encounters with angelic and demonic forces.

Highly recommended."--Library Journal<br><br>"A wise book."--Sr. Anna M. Denbla, Spalding University<br><br>"In recent years Howard Schwartz, combining the accumulative skills of scholarship with the lucently pure voice of the storyteller, has become the preeminent Jewish folklorist in America. What the Grimm brothers and Martin Buber gave to the German language, what Italo Calvino gave to the<br>Italian, Schwartz now gives to English: a landmark collection of tales that expands our common patrimony of legend and mystical treasure. Where Gabriel's Palace is uniquely Jewish, however, is in its God-soaked search, under the light of Torah, for the saintly deed."--Cynthia Ozick, author of The<br>Messiah of Stockholm and The Pagan Rabbi and Other Stories<br><br>"Once in a while, a book appears that is truly important. Gabriel's Palace is just such a volume. Howard Schwartz has gathered the essential tales that reflect the very foundations of Jewish mystical thought. His writing, as always, is beautiful, his research is breathtaking, his contribution<br>is extraordinary."--Arthur Kurzweil, author of From Generation to Generation<br><br>"Howard Schwartz, the foremost Jewish anthologist, has defined genres through his various collections of tales. In Elijah's Violin, he explored Jewish fairy tales; in Lilith's Cave he examined Jewish tales of the supernatural. Now, in Gabriel's Palace, he has collected mystical tales from a<br>wide range of Jewish sources in the first book of its kind. These brief imaginative stories, written in a fluid oral style by a master storyteller, are truly marvelous and miracle-filled. Through these stories, we see the circle forming, the mystical dance beginning, and we are drawn into the circle<br>to continue the spiritual journey of the Jewish people."--Peninnah Schram, author of Jewish Stories One Generation Tells Another and Tales of Elijah the Prophet<br><br>"A handsome collection of little known tales, lyrical enough to read at children's bedtime and scholarly enough to be assigned in class."--Alan F. Segal, Professor of Religions, Barnard College, Columbia University<br><br>"Tales drawn from the long traditions of Jewish mysticism and retold by Schwartz in an incomparably beautiful style for modern readers....The stories have been painstakingly researched, collected, and retold....An excellent gift book, a rare treasure trove. It's fascinatingly appealing and<br>enduring."--St. Louis Post-Dispatch<br><br>"You don't, of course, have to be Jewish to relish these sharp, clever, instructive anecdotes."--The Washington Post Book World</p><h2>Gregor Mendel: The First Geneticist</h2><p><em>Gregor Mendel: The First Geneticist</em> presents a lively, authoritative introduction to the man who discovered the laws of heredity and pioneered the study of genetics. Written by world-renowned Mendel scholar Vitezslav Orel, the book brilliantly traces Mendel's intellectual development, focusing in particular on his 1865 plant crossing experiments that revolutionized modern science. Throughout, Orel considers Mendel's contributions and personality in the unique social context in which he flourished. He also offers fascinating accounts of Mendel's fight for recognition, and the subsequent misuse of his theories by the Soviets and Nazis. <em>Gregor Mendel</em> offers the definitive systematic account of the great scientist's life and work.

Of the 100 organizations that spend the most on lobbying, 95 represent business. The largest companies now have upwards of 100 lobbyists representing them. How did American businesses become so invested in politics? And what does all their money buy? Drawing on extensive data and original interviews with corporate lobbyists, <em>The Business of America is Lobbying</em> provides a fascinating and detailed picture of what corporations do in Washington, why they do it, and why it matters. Since the 1970s, a wave of new government regulations and declining economic conditions has mobilized business leaders, and companies have developed new political capacities. Managers soon began to see public policy as an opportunity, not just a threat. . Ever since, corporate lobbying has become more pervasive, more proactive, and more particularistic. Lee Drutman argues that lobbyists drove this development by helping managers see the importance of politics and how proactive and aggressive engagement could help companies' bottom lines. Politics is messy, unpredictable, and more competitive than ever, but the growth of lobbying has driven several important changes that have increased the power of business in American politics. And now, the costs of effective lobbying have risen to a level that only larger businesses can typically afford. Lively and engaging, rigorous and nuanced, this will change how we think about lobbying-and how we might reform it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lee Drutman</strong> is a senior fellow in the program on political reform at New America. An expert on lobbying, influence, and money in politics, he has been quoted and/or cited in <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, Slate, Mother Jones, Vox, Politico</em>, and many other publications, and on <em>Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Planet Money, This American Life, Marketplace, Washington Journal</em>, and <em>The Colbert Report,</em> among other programs. Drutman also teaches in the Center for Advanced Governmental Studies at The John Hopkins University. Prior to coming to New America, Drutman was a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He has also worked in the U.S. Senate and at the Brookings Institution. He holds a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and a B.A. from Brown University.<br><br>"With careful research and an unflinching eye for telling detail, Lee Drutman shows beyond any doubt how big money is strangling our democracy, and why the rest of us must take action before its last gasp. A vitally important book everyone who cares about America must read." <br>-- Robert B. Reich, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley, and former U.S. Secretary of Labor <br><p></p><br>"Why do corporations lobby? How much do they spend to sway the federal government? Lee Drutman amassed the data to answer these hard questions and many others, including the hardest of all: what has lobbying done to American democracy?" <br>--David Frum, senior editor, <em>The Atlantic</em> <br><p></p><br>"The ever-rising amount that corporate America spends to shape government policy is hard to ignore-except, it seems, in American political science. Now, finally, we have a meticulous, innovative, yet remarkably readable analysis of the post-1970s lobbying boom: why it happened, how it feeds on itself, and how it is reshaping American politics. This book is likely to start a boom of its own, forcing political science to grapple with its fresh findings and powerful new arguments." <br>-- Jacob S. Hacker, Stanley B. Resor Professor of Political Science, Yale University, and co-author of <em>Winner-Take-All Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"Drutman's description of corporate lobbying, standing alone, is worth the price of admission. But he pairs this empirical work with sound judgment, sensible policy proposals, and a clear-eyed view of the world. It's an irresistible combination." <br>-- Heather K. Gerken, J. Skelly Wright Professor of Law, Yale Law School <br><p></p><br>"In the most impressive compilation of new data and analysis on corporate relations with the US government ever completed, Lee Drutman's painstaking and comprehensive study shows clearly how important individual corporations are in the federal lobbying game. At the same time, he shows just how dependent corporate leaders are on their government relations staff for knowledge about the value of the work of that very staff; how corporate lobbying is often as ineffective as it is self-perpetuating; and how it raises the cost of democracy for everyone. This will be seen for years as the best book on corporate lobbying in America and should be read by everyone with concern about how our government really works." <br>--Frank R. Baumgartner, Richard J. Richardson Distinguished Professor of Political Science, UNC-Chapel Hill, and co-author of <em>Lobbying and Policy Change</em> <br><p></p><br>"Drutman's book is a must-read for all who are concerned about the influence-peddling game. It alerts us to this growing threat to democracy itself, and it intrigues us to search for solutions." <br>--Craig Holman, <em>Public Citizen News</em><p></p><br>"...let me stress how edifying and entertaining I found The Business of America Is Lobbying. Anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of business, politics, and the growing intersection between the two should read Lee Drutman's book." <br>--Matthew Mitchell, George Mason University <br><p></p><br>"Drutman presents one of the more thoughtful analyses of lobbying in America that has been made so far." <br>--Jeff Madrick, <em>The New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Drutman offers a package of reforms. The proposals call for greater representation of noncorporate interests and increasing government's policymaking capacity. The latter raises the question of why Congress has not yet empowered itself. One possible answer that lessens businesses' fault for the current state of affairs is that just as firms are skilled at constrained optimization in their market and nonmarket environments, politicians are skilled at structuring the rules that govern these environments to their own benefit." <br>--<em>Political Science Quarterly</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Daily Readings With Julian of Norwich: 002</h2><p>Like the first volume in this series, Daily Readings with Julian of Norwich, Volume 2, consists of excerpts carefully chosen and arranged so as to give the substantial message of her spiritual masterpiece, The Revelations of Divine Love.</p><p></p><h2>Music in the Renaissance (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p>A history of Renaissance music focused on the music itself and the social and institutional contexts that shaped musical genres and performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; This book provides a complete overview of music in the 15th and 16th Centuries.&nbsp; It explains the most significant features of the music and the distinguishing characteristics of Renaissance composers (in Europe and the New World).&nbsp; It includes a large integrated anthology of 94 musical examples, as well as illustrations of musical instruments, notation, and ensembles.</p></p><p>An overview of music in the 15th and 16th centuries, with emphasis on the contributions of the greatest composers.Offers a complete overview of music in the 15th and 16th centuries -- with emphasis on the contributions of the greatest composers.

Except for a map legend, there is no explanation of atlas conventions or how to read maps. The atlas has maps for 41 regions or countries and four oceans. Regional and country maps have quite a bit of detail--major cities and towns and 12 physical features--but are nevertheless easy to read and do not bleed into the gutter even when they are spread across more than one page. Each map is accompanied by a few paragraphs of text, country flags, and a useful elevation (called "Land Height") legend. The U.S. section has four maps. Although this atlas does not have as many supplemental facts or graphics as some of the other atlases do, its clear maps are a plus. The foldout map of North America and the CD-ROM that come with the volume are better suited to home use. Kingfisher also has an atlas for ages 7 through 10, <i>The Kingfisher Children's Atlas</i>, which uses picture symbols; a new edition will be available in September. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Dennison, a world authority on cognitive skills and reading achievement, introduced the Brain Gym program in the mid-1980s. Today, the Brain Gym activities and balances are used in homes, schools, and businesses in more than 80 countries. In this inspiring addition to the Brain Gym series, Dr. Dennison shares his vision of children and adults learning in the way that is most natural: through movement. Dennison tells how he overcame his own learning challenges and discovered how stress can inhibit comprehension. Through personal stories, he simplifies the latest in neuroscience as it relates to learning. Dennison identifies the physical skills of learning that help learners shift from trying to doing their best. The case histories included show how people of all ages use the Brain Gym activities to learn, relax, remember, create, and achieve personal goals; the book also covers such unique Edu-K concepts as PACE, noticing, and the Three Dimensions of Learning.

The first comprehensive study of the New Deal in a global context, the book compares American responses to the international crisis of capitalism and democracy during the 1930s to responses by other countries around the globe&#x2015;not just in Europe but also in Latin America, Asia, and other parts of the world. Work creation, agricultural intervention, state planning, immigration policy, the role of mass media, forms of political leadership, and new ways of ruling America's colonies&#x2015;all had parallels elsewhere and unfolded against a backdrop of intense global debates.</p><p>By avoiding the distortions of American exceptionalism, Kiran Klaus Patel shows how America's reaction to the Great Depression connected it to the wider world. Among much else, the book explains why the New Deal had enormous repercussions on China; why Franklin D. Roosevelt studied the welfare schemes of Nazi Germany; and why the New Dealers were fascinated by cooperatives in Sweden&#x2015;but ignored similar schemes in Japan.</p><p>Ultimately, Patel argues, the New Deal provided the institutional scaffolding for the construction of American global hegemony in the postwar era, making this history essential for understanding both the New Deal and America's rise to global leadership.</p></p><p><p>"The first book to globalize the history of the New Deal, this is an amazing tour de force with fresh insights on virtually every page.

Immigrants are no longer rooted in one location. By building transnational social networks, economic alliances and political ideologies, they are able to cross the geographic and cultural boundaries of both their countries of origin and of settlement. Through ethnographic studies of immigrant populations, the authors demonstrate that transnationalism is something other than expanded nationalism. By placing immigrants in a limbo between settler and visitor, transnationalism challenges the concepts of citizenship and of nationhood itself.</p><p>"'This is an exciting book because it deals with a major issue of our times that is yet only poorly understood. Our authors show how transmigrants link their home countries with the countries of their sojourns, how this changes the state of affairs in both, and how we are all caught up in these changes. By looking closely at the lives of particular populations, the authors are able to illuminate important shifts and changes in the world.

A meeting with Dickon, her servant's brother begins her adventure and it is through their friendship and her relationship with her troubled hypochondriac cousin Colin that she begins to learn about herself. Their lives all begin to change when a Robin shows Mary the door to a mysterious secret garden.</p></p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>IELTS Express Intermediate: The Fast Track to IELTS Success (IELTS Express: The Fast Track to IELTS Success)</h2><p>IELTS Express is a two-level preparation course for students at intermediate (4 - 5.5) and Upper Intermediate (5.5 - 7) levels.

The author treats the development of state-level societies and their relationship to polities in Japan and China, and the development of a Korean ethnic identity. Emphasizing the particular features of the region, the author dispels the notion that the culture and traditions of Korea are pale imitations of those of its neighbors, China and Japan.</p><p>A survey of Korean prehistory from the earliest paleolithic settlers through the formation of the Three Kingdoms and the creation of United Silla in AD 668 dispels the notion that Korean culture and traditions are imitative of China and Japan.'There is no question but that Sarah Nelson's book is an important contribution to the English-language literature dealing with East Asian prehistory.' John W. Olsen, University of Arizona<br><br>'This long-awaited and much-needed book is a welcome addition to the teaching materials for East Asian archaeology ... a solid introduction to the archaeology of the peninsula from the Palaeolithic through the Three Kingdoms era.' Gina Barnes, University of Cambridge<br><br>'I warmly recommend this book both as an essential source of general information on Korean archaeology, and for its discussion of social and political issues which are of great relevance to understanding contemporary Korea.' James H. Grayson, Asian Affairs<br><br>'... the author has succeeded in placing Korea on the 'map of world archaeology'.'

His first book, &#34;Unfinished Dissertation&#34;, was published by Scalo in 1997, on the occasion of his receipt of the Albert Renger-Patzsch Prize; in 2000, he published his second book with Scalo, &#34;Case History&#34;, and was awarded the photo book award of the International Festival for Photography in Arles, France. Mikhailov also recently accepted an invitation to teach at Harvard University beginning in the fall of 2000. This new book contains a never-before published series of work from the early 1980s: Mikhailov photographed &#39;&#39;The Dancers&#39;&#39; in his hometown in the Ukraine during a period when the former Soviet Union was a reality, before the appearance of Gorbachov and &#34;perestroika&#34;. We observe the open-air dancing scene with great astonishment; seeing older and younger people enjoy themselves in a way that might be contradictory to the images we might have about everyday life in the old Soviet Union. These cheerful images remind us how little women and men need to have a good time. An essay by Russian art critic Boris Groys and an exhaustive interview make this volume a must have for readers and libraries interested in contemporary art and photography. Hardcover, 144 pages, 9 x 10 inches, 65 duotone illustrations.</p><p>Gunilla Knape is the curator of the Hasselblad Foundation in Gothenburg, Sweden. <p>Boris Groys is a Russian contemporary art critic who has also written on Rebecca Horn. He lives and works in Cologne, Germany.</p>Joining the likes of Cindy Sherman, Robert Frank, and William Eggleston, Mikhailov received the prestigious Hasselblad Award in 2000 for a body of work that spans from the heart of the Cold War to post-Soviet Ukrainian society. His haunting images often touch on the artifice of modern life but are mostly documentary in content and style, and he is best known in the United States, at least for images of decaying civilization during the years under and just after Soviet rule (see, for instance, Unfinished Dissertation and Case Study). So the 1978 series of dreamy photographs reproduced here at first seems unrepresentative, showing happy couples dancing an afternoon away in a large communal courtyard. While neither the four-page essay nor the six-page interview focuses on this series, they do help the reader to understand Mikhailov's motivations here and in the more brooding work and to create ties between them. General collections might wait for a more complete retrospective of this talented photographer's work, but art and photography collections should add this small gem.

Born only a month after the death of beloved Confederate hero general J.E.B. Stuart during a string of Confederate victories, Winnie&#x2019;s birth was hailed as a blessing by war-weary Southerners. They felt her arrival was a good omen signifying future victory. But after the Confederacy&#x2019;s ultimate defeat in the Civil War, Winnie would spend her early life as a genteel refugee and an expatriate abroad.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the South from German boarding school, Winnie was christened the &#x201c;Daughter of the Confederacy&#x201d; in 1886. This role was bestowed upon her by a Southern culture trying to sublimate its war losses. Particularly idolized by Confederate veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Winnie became an icon of the Lost Cause, eclipsing even her father Jefferson in popularity.&nbsp; <br><i></i>&nbsp;<i>Winnie Davis:&nbsp; Daughter of the Lost Cause</i> is the first published biography of this little-known woman who unwittingly became the symbolic female figure of the defeated South. Her controversial engagement in 1890 to a Northerner lawyer whose grandfather was a famous abolitionist, and her later move to work as a writer in New York City, shocked her friends, family, and the Southern groups who worshipped her. Faced with the pressures of a community who violently rejected the match, Winnie desperately attempted to reconcile her prominent Old South history with her personal desire for tolerance and acceptance of her personal choices.&nbsp; <br></p><p><p>HEATH HARDAGE LEE&nbsp;has a background in museum education and historic preservation.

One hundred and twenty biblical scholars from twenty-two faith traditions worked as translators. These women and men balanced rigorous accuracy in translation of the ancient texts with an equally passionate commitment to clarity of expression in contemporary English. The result is a clear, direct, and powerful English version of the scriptures for use in Bible study, devotional reading, and worship.The Common English Bible, likely the largest cross-denominational translation project in recent memory, unites Baptist, Catholic, Evangelical, United Methodist, and numerous other faith traditions in a joint effort to create a complete but broadly accessible Bible for the 21st century. No single translation, despite the breadth of this committee&#39;s reach, is likely to please all, but this sincere and diligent effort goes far toward the creation of a plain-English version that, without falling into folksiness or false hipsterism, can be read and understood by a range of ages, educational backgrounds, and aptitudes.--Library Journal (03/01/2011)</p><h2>The Fateful Choice: Japan&#39;s Advance into Southeast Asia, 1941</h2><p>The Fateful Choice: Japan's Advance Into Southeast Asia, 1939-1941 was edited by James William Morley.

Carl Smith&#x2019;s fascinating history reveals the <i>Plan</i>&#x2019;s central role in shaping the ways people envision the cityscape and urban life itself. <br> <br> Smith&#x2019;s concise and accessible narrative begins with a survey of Chicago&#x2019;s stunning rise from a tiny frontier settlement to the nation&#x2019;s second-largest city. He then offers an illuminating exploration of the <i>Plan</i>&#x2019;s creation and reveals how it embodies the renowned architect&#x2019;s belief that cities can and must be remade for the better. The <i>Plan</i> defined the City Beautiful movement and was the first comprehensive attempt to reimagine a major American city. Smith points out the ways the <i>Plan</i> continues to influence debates, even a century after its publication, about how to create a vibrant and habitable urban environment. <br> <br> Richly illustrated and incisively written, his insightful book will be indispensable to our understanding of Chicago, Daniel Burnham, and the emergence of the modern city.</p></p><p><b>Carl Smith</b> is the Franklyn Bliss Snyder Professor of English and American Studies and professor of history at Northwestern University.

Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, and Henry Ford--the Gilded Age is a time of big money. Technology boomed with the invention of trains, telephones, electric lights, harvesters, vacuum cleaners, and more. But for millions of immigrant workers, it is a time of big struggles, with adults and children alike working 12 to 14 hours a day under extreme, dangerous conditions.

Mendicant commitment to apostolic poverty bound friars to donors in an exchange of donations in return for intercessory prayers and burial: association with friars was believed to reduce the suffering of purgatory. Mendicant convents became urban cemeteries, warehouses filled with family tombs, flags, shields, and private altars.<br> &nbsp;<br> As mendicants became progressively institutionalized and sought legitimacy, friars adopted the architectural structures of monasticism: chapter houses, cloisters, dormitories, and refectories. &nbsp;They also created piazzas for preaching and burying outside their churches. Construction depended on assembling adequate funding from communes, confraternities, and private individuals; it was also sometimes supported by the expropriation of property from heretics.&nbsp; Because of irregular funding, construction was episodic, with substantial changes in scale and design. Choir screens served as temporary west fa�ades while funds were raised for completion. This is the first book to analyze the friars&#x2019; influence on the growth and transformation of medieval buildings and urban spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>This fascinating book considers how the mission of mendicant friars to go out into society helped reconfigure urban space and had a profound influence on city architecture in medieval times.<br><b>Caroline Bruzelius</b> is the A.

He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable Madness and Civilization; hospitals in The Birth of the Clinic; prisons in Discipline and Punish; and schools and families in The History of Sexuality. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them.<br><br>Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent -- and terrifying -- portrait of society that he was patiently compiling.<br><br>For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power "reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives"<br><br>Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time -- and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.</p><p>Michel Foucault was born in Poitiers, France, in 1926. He lecturerd in universities throughout the world; served as director at the Institut Francais in Hamburg, Germany and at the Institut de Philosophi at the Faculte des Lettres in the University of Clermont-Ferrand, France; and wrote frequently for French newspapers and reviews.

Creating an archaeological narrative of the migration of the Philistines, he combines an innovative theoretical framework on the archaeology of migration with new data from excavations in Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel and thereby reconstructs the social history of the Aegean migration to the southern Levant. The author follows the story of the migrants from the conditions that caused the Philistines to leave their Aegean homes, to their movement eastward along the sea and land routes, to their formation of a migrant society in Philistia and their interaction with local populations in the Levant. Based on the most up-to-date evidence, this book offers a new and fresh understanding of the arrival of the Philistines in the Levant.</p><p>Assaf Yasur-Landau is Senior Researcher at the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies, Haifa University. He has edited three volumes and published numerous articles on the the archaeology of the Levant and interactions between the Aegean world and the Levant, including the Philistine migration, with an emphasis on the investigation of the personal lives of ancient people.&#39;This book is published exactly one hundred years after the first book on the Philistines a book by the British archaeologist R. A. St Macalister (The Philistines, 1911). While Macalister had very few sources at his disposal, Yasur-Landau can reply on extensive archaeological research as well as on a large body of literature, including the books published by Moshe and Trude Dothan published between 1967 and 2006.&#39; International Review of Biblical Studies&#34;</p><h2>The Horizontal World: Growing Up in the Middle of Nowhere: A Memoir</h2><p>An evocative memoir of growing up on a family farm in rural North Dakota, on land her family had worked for generations, reflects on her desire to escape the difficult life, her relationship with and admiration for her father, and the influence of place on personal identity.</p><p>An associate professor of English, Debra Marquart is the coordinator of the Creative Writing Program at Iowa State University. She is the author of <i>The Hunger Bone: Rock &amp; Roll Stories</i>, and the poetry collections <i>Everything's a Verb</i> and <i>From Sweetness</i>. Marquart's essays have three times been cited as Notable Essays in <i>Best American Essays</i>, and she has been awarded the Shelby Foote Nonfiction Prize (Faulkner Society), the Writer's Digest Nonfiction Award, and a Pushcart Prize, among other commendations. She lives in Ames, Iowa.Marquart has an interesting bio: she's a North Dakota farm girl, former rock-and-roll band member, college dropout, professor, and Pushcart Prize-winning writer. Born into a dairy-farm family, like many young people she flees as soon as she is able, taking with her the experiences that have determined the line of her backbone. She carries the spark of her -Russian-born immigrant grandfather, who created a hard yet rewarding life for his family in harsh and arid North Dakota, and senses that her wildness is a trait inherited from her creative, slightly off-balance great aunt. Marquart writes sweetly and wistfully of her ties to the past, which both tangle her up and serve as a safety net. She isn't hit with any blinding revelations while contemplating herself in the mirror of her life but rather acquires a deeper appreciation for where she's been and where she's landed. Readers will particularly relate to her musings about her father's death as she explores her coming-of-midlife discoveries. <i>Pamela Crossland</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Because the phenomena described by quantum theory are often remote from our daily existence, our intuition about the nature of quantum systems must be built up from sources other than direct experience; the visual display of quantitative information and qualitative ideas can play just as important a role in this learning process as do formal mathematical methods. <br> <em>Quantum Mechanics: Classical Results, Modern Systems, and Visualized Examples</em> provides the student with a thorough background in the machinery of undergraduate quantum mechanics, with many examples taken from classic experiments in atomic, nuclear, and elementary particle physics. In addition, the use of visualization is heavily emphasized throughout.</p><p>Richard W.

Dr. Robin Baker, who has studied sperm and cervical mucus in much greater detail than anyone would&#39;ve thought necessary, has come to some startling conclusions: that less than 1 percent of sperm is actually designed to fertilize an egg (the rest are there to block other men&#39;s sperm), and that 4 to 10 percent of all children born to married couples are in fact the offspring of other men, usually of higher socioeconomic status, with whom the mother had a short-term relationship.Robin Baker is a lecturer at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Manchester.</p><h2>Eros Visible: Art, Sexuality and Antiquity in Renaissance Italy</h2><p>Focusing on the impact of the erotic revolution that swept through 16th-century Italy, <i>Eros Visible </i>presents a compendious, revisionist account of High Renaissance art. Through close visual analysis of artworks and careful reading of related texts, James Grantham Turner demonstrates the surprisingly close connection between explicitly pornographic art and the canonical works of masters such as Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Full of new discoveries, this volume explores the passionate response to antiquity and how a new sex-positive philosophy not only encouraged an increased accentuation of sensual and erotic themes in art, but influenced the sexual cultures of both the court and the art studio. With an interdisciplinary approach that draws on a wide array of visual and textual erotica, Turner offers the first broad, synthetic history of the classically inspired and unambiguously lascivious sensibilities behind some of the most sublime artistic achievements of the Renaissance.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>An eye-opening investigation of how artists of the High Renaissance were influenced and inspired by the sexually charged culture of 16th-century Italy.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<b>James Grantham Turner </b>is the James D.

The second volume in a three-volume commentary, it easily maintains the high standards of academic excellence established by <i>Isaiah</i><i>1</i>-3<i>9</i>.<br><br> Second Isaiah was written in the sixth century b.c.e., in the years just before the fall of the mighty Babylonian Empire, by an anonymous prophet whom history has erroneously identified with the real Isaiah (born ca. 765 b.c.e.). Scholars know Second Isaiah was written by someone other than Isaiah because the contexts of these prophecies are so very different. When Second Isaiah was written, the prophet believed that Israel's time of suffering was drawing to a close. There was, he insisted, a new age upon them, a time of hope, peace, and renewed national prosperity. The main thrust of the prophet's argument was intended to rally the spirits of a people devastated by war and conquest. One of the most famous examples of this optimistic tone is the well-known and beloved Song of the Suffering Servant, which is found in Chapters 52-53, and about which Blenkinsopp has some challenging new ideas.<br><br> The final chapters of Second Isaiah, however, are in an entirely different key as it becomes clear that the new world the prophet foresaw earlier was not going to come to pass. This despair finds its most poignant expression in the final section of the Book of Isaiah, which Blenkinsopp will address in his forthcoming third volume.</p><p><p><b>Joseph Blenkinsopp</b> is currently the John A.

In Robert Larson&#39;s sympathetic appraisal, Red Cloud&#39;s deliberate deceptiveness was part of a delaying tactic to sustain Lakota culture in an increasingly hostile environment. Eventually concluding that the white invaders could not be stopped, the fierce fighter became a wily negotiator who wrung some concessions from the U.S. government as he presided over his people&#39;s transition from nomadism to reservation life. It&#39;s a sad story, told with sensitive awareness of history&#39;s painful ambiguities.Robert W.

The author of <i>The Moviegoer</i> and <i>Lancelot,</i> Walker Percy, seems always to have been a solitary wayfarer, despite an enduring marriage and close friendships, including a lifelong one with novelist and Civil War historian Shelby Foote. In Jay Tolson's assessment, the weight of his father's and grandfather's suicides bore heavily on Percy, whose desire to escape his deadly family legacy undoubtedly had a bearing on his choice of the Catholic faith at age 31.Percy the novelist was arguably the most legitimate apologist for orthodox Christianity in modern letters. A convert to Catholicism, Percy mourned this century's loss of a sense of sin, destroyed by the sensations and temptations offered by the richest country on earth. As a result, he created characters who sought the source of their alienation. Tolson's biography is a skillful synthesis of the trivia of Percy's life, the evolution of his thought, and the substance of his novels. Echoing Percy's belief that history and family history are hopelessly interwoven, Tolson dwells perhaps more than usual on the author's forebears in the South, where they had been prominent for generations. Percy trained as a doctor but contracted tuberculosis while autopsying cadavers at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, which influenced his decision to become a writer. It was his reading of Kierkegaard that alerted him to the useful paradox that true individuality is won only through submission to a higher authority. A substantial biography of a very substantial writer.<br><i>- Jack Shreve, Allegany Community Coll., Cumberland, Md.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Life and Death of Planet Earth: How the New Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World</h2><p><br>In a landmark work of science two distinguished scientists offer a vivid narrative describing the second half of the life of our planet<br> Planet Earth is middle-aged. Science has worked hard to piece together the story of the evolution of our world up to this point, but only recently have we developed the understanding and the tools to describe the entire life cycle of a planet-of our planet. <br>Peter Ward and Don Brownlee, a geologist and an astronomer respectively, are in the vanguard of the new field of astrobiology. Combining their knowledge of how the critical sustaining systems of our planet evolve through time with their understanding of how stars and solar systems grow and change throughout their own life cycles, the authors tell the story of the second half of Earth's life. The process of planetary evolution will essentially reverse itself; life as we know it will subside until only the simplest forms remain. Eventually, they too will disappear. The oceans will evaporate, the atmosphere will degrade, and, as the sun slowly expands, Earth itself will eventually meet a fiery end. <br>In this masterful melding of groundbreaking research and captivating, eloquent science writing, Ward and Brownlee provide a comprehensive portrait of Earth's life cycle that allows us to understand and appreciate how the planet sustains itself today, and offers us a glimpse of our place in the cosmic order.<br><br></p><p><br>Peter Ward and Don Brownlee are the co-authors of the acclaimed and bestselling <i>Rare Earth</i>.

Ruth Ward, born in 1916, aged gracefully but never resembled her youth again. Hers was a one-way trip. Planets have a different trajectory&#x2014;the Earth, for instance, appears to be on a round trip of sorts. If you fire a cannon straight up, the projectile climbs to a certain height, slows, stops, and then falls back to the ground. Our planet's trajectory is similar. It started as a very hot, oxygen-free world. Water, air, plants, solar energy, and plate tectonics created the conditions for natural evolution, and many people assume that the cannonball of biological complexity is still arcing upward. We believe that the cannonball has already begun to drop, and that the Earth has already started a return to a hot world where life becomes less diverse, less complicated, and less abundant through time. The last life on Earth may look much like the first life&#x2014;a single-celled bacterium, survivor and descendant of all that came before.<br><br></p><h2>Selected Writings of Judith Sargent Murray (Women Writers in English 1350-1850)</h2><p>As a novelist, essayist, dramatist, and poet, Judith Sargent Murray candidly and often humorously asserted her opinions about the social and political conditions of women in late eighteenth-century America. As a committed feminist, she urged American women to enter a "new era in female history," yet published some of her own writings under a man's name in hopes of more widely disseminating her ideas. In addition to her literary endeavors Murray was a prolific letter-writer, and revealed in her correspondence, as elsewhere, her unwavering commitment to human rights. Also during this period, Murray produced numerous sketches of celebrated female contemporaries and her major work, <em>The Gleaner</em>.<br> <br>With selections from <em>The Gleaner</em> and Murray's other publications, this latest addition to the <em>Women Writers in English</em> series unearths an important early feminist voice, one that should engage the intellect and imagination of readers both inside and outside the academy.<br></p><p>Judith Sargent Murray (1751-1820) was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and spent most of her life in New England, where her extraordinary intellectual achievements gained recognition in literary and political circles of the late eighteenth century. Author of &#34;On the Equality of the Sexes&#34; (1790), Murray was one of America&#39;s earliest feminist writers and a gifted satirist. She was one of the first women in America to have her own literary column (in Massachusetts Magazine), and the first American to have a play produced on the Boston stage. In addition to writing essays, plays, poetry, and fiction, Murray was a prolific letter writer. Throughout her long career, she focused on the themes of women&#39;s education, history, and contributions to American culture. In 1798, one hundred of her essays from Massachusetts Magazine were collected and published in a single volume, The Gleaner. The Selected Writings features Murray&#39;s &#34;On the Equality of the Sexes&#34; and other essays from The Gleaner; selected correspondence; a play, The Traveller Returned; and Murray&#39;s only novel, The Story of Margaretta.

In this study, George S. Williamson examines the factors that gave rise to this distinct and profound longing for myth. In doing so, he demonstrates the entanglement of aesthetic and philosophical ambitions in Germany with some of the major religious conflicts of the nineteenth century.<br><br>Through readings of key intellectuals ranging from Herder and Schelling to Wagner and Nietzsche, Williamson highlights three crucial factors in the emergence of the German engagement with myth: the tradition of Philhellenist neohumanism, a critique of contemporary aesthetic and public life as dominated by private interests, and a rejection of the Bible by many Protestant scholars as the product of a foreign, "Oriental" culture. According to Williamson, the discourse on myth in Germany remained bound up with problems of Protestant theology and confessional conflict through the nineteenth century and beyond.<br><br>A compelling adventure in intellectual history, this study uncovers the foundations of Germany's fascination with myth and its enduring cultural legacy.<b>George Williamson</b> is an assistant professor of history at the University of Alabama.</p><h2>Gruhn&#39;s Guide to Vintage Guitars</h2><p>The original version of this guide has sold over 30,000 copies.

Detailing thousands of models by every major manufacturer, the book now includes expanded coverage of Martin, Guild, Mosrite, Dobro, Gibson banjos, Fender amps, Gibson amps, plus updates on the latest models from Fender, Gibson, Rickenbacker, and others since 1990. 582 pages, 6 inch. x 9 inch.</p><p>Authors George Gruhn and Walter Carter are no strangers to fretted instruments: Gruhn runs one of the best vintage instrument stores in the country, and Carter was Gibson's company historian for several years in the 1990s. In the second edition to <i>Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars</i>, the pair have created a useful resource for any lover of fine guitars, banjos, or basses. Though not a price guide, the book will enable collectors to identify the date, stock ingredients, wood, and evolution of their Fender, Martin, Gibson, Gretsch, or Mosrite axes, to name just a few. Many readers will probably want to complement this book with a separate price guide (<i>The Official Vintage Guitar Magazine Price Guide</i> is recommended), and it should be noted that many mass-market manufacturers (Kay, for instance) were left out. But with this book you'll at least know that the stock Epiphone Madrid you bought on the Internet is, in fact, truly stock. A great resource for lovers of collectable six-strings. <i>--Jason Verlinde</i>The market for vintage American guitars, basses, amplifiers, banjos, ukuleles, and other fretted instruments has exploded in the last decade. This updated and expanded second edition of Gruhn's Guide is more than double the size of its first edition (1992) and is superior in breadth, depth, and timeliness. The guide is organized by manufacturer and type of instrument. Every model is described in detail, with introduction date, body shape and size, woods, pickups (where applicable), bindings, inlays, and finish. All changes made from year to year are noted, ensuring the precise determination of model and originality. The book also provides serial number lists, identification charts, and over 100 photos of special features. While many books on individual instrument makers are available, this is the only guide that lists all makers and all their products while also offering comments about the collectibility of specific instruments.

No one even knew anything had gone wrong until the International Space Station was over the Atlantic, a tiny dot of light heading toward the west coast of Africa, not a single earthly eye on it, and we only found out at camp because Jackson Kimmel had an aunt who worked at NASA.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was not an astronaut.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was in human resources, so she didn&#x2019;t actually do anything with the space program, but she texted her nephew, because space was his &#x201c;thing,&#x201d; and her nephew told me, because he knew space was also my &#x201c;thing,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s how summer camp works: find someone whose thing is your thing and geek out together.<br> &nbsp;<br> It would&#x2019;ve been nice if I&#x2019;d had someone to geek out with who wasn&#x2019;t a ten-year-old.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They think it was an impact with space junk,&#x201d; Jackson said, waving his arms around while he circled me. He was one of those kids in constant, exhausting motion. &#x201c;Did you know that NASA tracks over half a million pieces of space debris that orbit the earth? It travels at seventeen thousand five hundred miles per hour, so, like, that could cut through a space station. Usually they have all kinds of warnings and ways to maneuver around space junk. They call it the &#x2018;pizza box&#x2019; because it&#x2019;s an imaginary box that&#x2019;s a mile deep and thirty miles wide around the vehicle, and if anything looks like it&#x2019;s gonna get too close to the &#x2018;box,&#x2019; they take steps to keep the astronauts and the equipment safe, but not all the debris is tracked, so maybe they missed something? My aunt doesn&#x2019;t know; she just does paperwork for people&#x2019;s travel to conferences. She got to meet Leland Melvin once. Do you know who he is? He&#x2019;s spent over five hundred sixty-five hours in space during his career, but you probably know him as the astronaut who took his official NASA portrait with his dogs? You ever see it? The dogs&#x2019; names are Jack and Scout. Or Jake? I can&#x2019;t remember. Do you have a dog? I named my dog Elon, after Elon Musk, but now I think that--&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, Jackson.&#x201d; I interrupted his monologue. He had actually made air quotes with his fingers around the words &#x201c;pizza box.&#x201d; What ten-year-old makes air quotes? &#x201c;Take a breath and change for basketball.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His smile vanished, his face a crash landing, no survivors.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do I haaaave to?&#x201d; he whined. I wanted to tell him, No, of course not! Who sends their ten-year-old space nerd to a sports camp when there is an actual place called Space Camp! Your parents should be punished for this! But sports were required at Camp Winatoo, and Jackson had to go play basketball before he could come back for afternoon science club in Craft Cabin.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was my unfortunate duty to make him go play basketball, just as it had been some other seventeen-year-old counselor-in-training&#x2019;s job to force me to go play basketball when I was a ten-year-old space nerd here. That&#x2019;s the curse of the indoor kids. People are always trying to make us go outside and play. The bastards.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now I was one of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you have to,&#x201d; I told him.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would have much rather spent the morning talking about the merits of the Falcon 9 rocket in commercial applications, but that wasn&#x2019;t an option, not if I wanted to keep my job. The silver lining of this job was that I, personally, did not have to go to basketball. I had the entire early afternoon to do what I pleased. I was extremely lucky today, because I didn&#x2019;t even have to supervise the aftermath of basketball, which was one of the worst jobs you could have. Those kids smelled ripe. Old enough for BO, not quite old enough to have figured out deodorant. And the ones that had figured it out? Axe Body Spray might be the worst thing to have happened in the history of mankind. It&#x2019;s chemical warfare marketed to tweens.<br> &nbsp;<br> After Jackson skulked off in his too-big basketball jersey, I pulled out my phone, trying to see if there was any news about the space station. Nothing had hit the mainstream media yet, but @GeekHeadNebula on Twitter had posted about a possible catastrophic hull breach impacting all ISS life-support systems.<br> &nbsp;<br> That seemed a bit dramatic, in the way of breaking news, and I knew the reality would end up more mundane. Not that the mundane couldn&#x2019;t be deadly in the void of space. It was usually the mundane that turned deadly up there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kind of like my life on Earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Deadly Mundane could&#x2019;ve been the title of my autobiography. Nothing dramatic ever happened to me. I was a junior counselor at the same summer camp I&#x2019;d gone to as a kid, where I&#x2019;d known most of the other junior counselors since forever. Back home, I lived in the suburbs and went to the kind of school where teenagers on the Disney Channel would go: everything was well lit and oversaturated, every adult was caring and concerned and a bit clueless, and every family was more affluent than the national average, but not so affluent that we&#x2019;d be the bad guys in a dystopian novel.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d had my bar mitzvah and come out of the closet the same year, and both went . . . fine. I almost cried when my voice cracked during the haftorah recitation, and I also almost cried when my dad told me he was proud I was &#x201c;living my truth.&#x201d; The bar mitzvah involved me getting envelopes with eighteen-dollar checks in them, and coming out involved my mom putting a pride flag on our car.

The relevance of understanding the trends it depicts has only increased, especially in light of the current urban crisis puncturing a long period of gentrification and new economy development, putting us on the precipice, perhaps, of the next new bohemia.</p></p><p><p><strong>Richard Lloyd</strong> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Vanderbilt University</p>The increasingly intimate but still uneasy relationship between "alternative" cultures and the forces of globalization underlies Vanderbilt professor Lloyd's sparkling ethnographic study of Chicago's hipster enclave Wicker Park. Once the down-at-heel home of Frankie Machine, the junkie protagonist of Nelson Algren's [<i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i>], it's now the sort of neighborhood where one can look at art, linger over a cafe americano, listen to poetry or indie rock, or be cordially abused by record store clerks straight out of <i>High Fidelity</i>, which was filmed there. Good on the big picture, Lloyd's 10 chapters situate the evolving neighborhood within a complex nexus of commercial and social forces that he calls the "aesthetic economy." But as thorough (and commendably dogma- and jargon-free) as Lloyd is on background, it is in the "field" that he shines, bringing abstract concepts to life with a real feel for the "new economy" bars, galleries and high-tech startups, as well as the often happily exploited people who work in them. Trading high wages for the romance of bohemia, the bartenders, baristas and code punchers of Wicker Park are evolving new codes and values often strikingly at odds with suburban ones, and Lloyd's study gives their evolution a wealth of nuanced human detail. This combination of solid research and a good ear gives Lloyd's book an unusual depth; none of his readers is likely to undertip an eyebrow-studded waitserver anytime soon. 15 b&amp;w photos. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Word of their fabulous food quickly spread, turning their culinary "speakeasy," Starry Kitchen, into an underground sensation&#x2014;and the #1 Asian fusion restaurant in L.A. on Yelp. </p><p>Threatened by the city&#x2019;s health inspector, Nguyen and Thi transformed Starry Kitchen into an acclaimed and wildly popular pop-up restaurant in a downtown sushi joint.

Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking. Among the insights presented here is the ironical finding that capitalism was originally supposed to accomplish exactly what was soon denounced as its worst feature: the repression of the passions in favor of the "harmless," if one-dimensional, interests of commercial life. To portray this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith.</p><br><p> Featuring a new afterword by Jeremy Adelman and a foreword by Amartya Sen, this Princeton Classics edition of <i>The Passions and the Interests</i> sheds light on the intricate ideological transformation from which capitalism emerged triumphant, and reaffirms Hirschman's stature as one of our most influential and provocative thinkers.</p></p><p><b>Albert O.

Among the selections included here are "Proverbs of Hell" from <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell </i>&#x2015; a satire on religion and morality considered Blake's most inspired and original work; "A Song of Liberty," "The Argument," "The Mental Traveller," "Gwin, King of Norway," "The Land of Dreams," "William Bond," "To the Evening Star," and many more.</p><p>Painter, printer, and poet, William Blake (1757-1827) was a master at expressing great literature through his art.

Arguing that good schools are first and foremost strong communities, Strike maintains that the small schools movement is the best hope to create such schools. He shows how the core assumptions that characterize the &#x201c;community paradigm&#x201d; are preferable to those of standards-based reform and choice. Part I examines student disengagement as an issue largely unaddressed by current views of school reform; demonstrates that belonging is essential to authentic learning; and argues that good schools create a sense that &#x201c;we are all in this together.&#x201d; Good schools have a &#x201c;shared educational project&#x201d; and exhibit the four Cs of community: coherence, cohesion, care, and connectivity. Part II discusses the small schools movement. The author shows that small size is not sufficient to create strong communities or good schools&#x2015;we cannot just downsize and hope that something good will happen. Strike looks at the educational practices and policies required to create successful small schools, and develops a view of accountability appropriate for building successful educational communities. He argues that if we expect small schools to be successful we cannot view them as simply a strategy for succeeding on standards-based reform, but rather we must see the creation of strong communities as a distinct paradigm for school reform.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;This is a book that has profoundly shifted my approach to urban education.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Matthew C.

But for distinguished Harvard economist Henry Spearman it offered diversion of a decidedly different sort and one he'd hardly anticipated: murder.</p><p>While the island police force is mired in an investigation that leads everywhere and nowhere, the diminutive, balding Spearman, who likes nothing better than to train his curiosity on human behavior, conducts an investigation of his own, one governed by rather different laws&#x2015;those of economics.

In<i> No Precedent, No Plan</i>, Martin Gilman offers an insider's view of Russia's financial crisis. As the senior representative of the International Monetary Fund in Moscow beginning in 1996, Gilman was in the eye of the storm. Now, he tells the dramatic story of Russia's economic evolution following the collapse of the Soviet Union and analyzes the 1998 crisis and its aftermath. </p><p>Gilman argues that the default and collapse, although avoidable, actually spurred Russia to integrate its economy with the rest of the world's and served as a harbinger of the recent global economic crisis. Gilman details the IMF's involvement and defends it against criticism by economist Joseph Stiglitz and others. In the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union left Russia in chaos, with a barely functioning government and no consensus on the path toward a democratic and economic transformation. The smooth transition to a market economy that had been accomplished in other countries in Eastern Europe was impossible. Gilman describes the ordeal of the 1998 crisis and argues that the IMF helped Russia avoid an even greater catastrophe. He recounts Russia's emergence from the IMF's tutelage and explains how the shell-shocked Russian public turned to Vladimir Putin in search of stability after the trauma of 1998. </p><p><i>No Precedent, No Plan</i> offers a definitive account&#x2015;the first from an insider's perspective&#x2015;of Russia's painful transition to a market economy.</p></p><p>Martin Gilman, with the International Monetary Fund from 1981 to 2005, was the IMF&#39;s senior representative in Moscow during Russia&#39;s period of default and rebuilding.

Houses, shops, and villages all have a pull on the human heart; this book is the most comprehensive look yet at the myriad ways of painting the places where we live, pray, and work. Using a broad variety of examples from contemporary artists like George Kountoupis and Tony Couch, Wolf opens by covering drawing and perspective, composition, and color harmony. In the latter, richer half of the book, she looks at building textures (brick in watercolor, sandstone in mixed media, weathered wood in pencil or oil), and provides more than a dozen demonstrations in watercolor, acrylic, and oils.

From its origins in seventeenth-century England to the current practice of lining out among some Baptist congregations in the American South today, William Dargan&#x2019;s study illuminates a unique American music genre in a richly textured narrative that stretches from Isaac Watts to Aretha Franklin and Ornette Coleman.<br><br> <i>Lining Out the Word </i>traces the history of lining out from the time of slavery, when African American slaves adapted the practice for their own uses, blending it with other music, such as work songs. Dargan explores the role of lining out in worship and pursues the cultural implications of this practice far beyond the limits of the church, showing how African Americans wove African and European elements together to produce a powerful and unique cultural idiom. Drawing from an extraordinary range of sources&#x2015;including his own fieldwork and oral sources&#x2015;Dargan offers a compelling new perspective on the emergence of African American music in the United States.<br><br><i>Copub: Center for Black Music Research</i></p><p><b>William T.

Currently professor emeritus at San Diego State University, Dr. Robbins' research interests have focused on conflict, power, and politics in organizations, behavioral decision making, and the development of effective interpersonal skills. His articles on these and other topics have appeared in <i>Business Horizons</i>, <i>California Management Review</i>, <i>Business and Economic Perspectives</i>, <i>International Management</i>, <i>Management Review</i>, <i>The Journal of Management Education</i>, and other leading journals.</p> <p>An avid participant in masters' track and field, Dr. Robbins has set numerous indoor and outdoor age-group world sprint records since turning 50 in 1993. He has won more than a dozen indoor and outdoor U.S. national titles at 60m, 100m, 200m, and 400m, and has won seven gold medals at the World Masters Championships.</p><p>Few issues so widely affect our daily lives as dramatically as does the quality of our decisions. How much you earn, your health status, your relationships, and your overall level of happiness are just a sampling of outcomes that are largely due to decisions you've made.</p> <p>In spite of the importance of making good decisions, few of us have had any formal training in the process. You couldn't graduate from high school without classes in English, math, science, government, and history, but did you have any courses in decision making? Probably not. If you want to be good at cooking, you take courses in cooking. The same is true for drawing, doing financial analysis, or healing the sick. Most of us even took a formal class in typing to develop our proficiency for such a mundane task as key-boarding. But, for some reason, it's just assumed that, through practice and experience, all of us can learn to be good decision makers.</p> <p>A little observation tells us rather quickly that everyone doesn't make good decisions. Apparently, practice and experience aren't very good teachers of this skill. I, for one, continue to be amazed at the bad decisions some people make. They buy stocks at their peak prices and sell them when they're near their lows. They play slot machines and bet on other games of chance as if there is such a thing as a "hot streak," or they marry a person that they know is wrong for them. (For evidence on this last point, watch some of the daytime talk shows and listen to guests contrive explanations for staying with partners who continually lie and cheat on them.)</p> <p>We know a great deal about how people make decisions and how to improve the process. Unfortunately, this knowledge is not widespread. The purpose of <br>Decide &amp; Conquer<br> is to change that. Drawing on thousands of research studies, this book translates what experts know about behavioral decision processes into layman terms with heavy emphasis on application. I wrote this book as an everyman's guide on how to improve the choices that shape our lives, and, after reading this book, you will have the tools to make better decisions. What qualifies me to write this book? I've been researching and writing about organizational decision making for nearly 30 years. My textbook on organizational behavior, for instance, is now in its 10th edition and has been read by more than a million students. The behavioral decision-making literature is a fundamental component in understanding organizational behavior. I wrote <br>Decide &amp; Conquer<br> because I thought I could bring my "translating" skills to the behavioral decision-making literature and make this literature more accessible to people with a nontechnical background.</p> <p>Keep in mind that giving you the tools to make better decisions is not the same as helping you to make the right decisions. This book is designed to show you the right way to structure and analyze problems. It focuses on the process you use to arrive at your decisions. That's because a good decision should be judged by the process used, not the results achieved. In some cases, a "good decision" results in an undesirable outcome. If you used the right process, however, you will have made a good decision regardless of the outcome. So I can't tell you what to decide, but I can show you how to decide. Unfortunately, because chance events influence outcomes, there can be no assurances that using the right process will result in a desirable outcome, but it does increase that probability.</p> <p>This book has been organized into five parts. Part I argues that decision making permeates everything we do and that all of us need to know the right way to make decisions. Part II proposes that improving your decision making begins by understanding your personality traits and how they shape your decision-making preferences. Part III describes, in detail, biases and shortcuts that many of us use that hinder our decision-making effectiveness. Part IV describes a number of insights that can help you improve your decision making. Part V is a one-chapter brief summary of what you should have gotten out of reading this book.</p> <p>A book like this owes its existence to two distinct sets of contributors. First are those scholars who have studied the psychology of human judgment and decision making and have shared their research with us. The insights you'll find in this book are the culmination of decades of research by hundreds of scholars such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Herbert A. Simon, Baruch Fischhoff, and Paul Slovic. My role here is similar to that played by television news anchors. TV news anchors don't make the news; they just report it. Similarly, I didn't "make" the findings you'll read about in this book; I merely report them. My contribution was to review the thousands of studies that have been done on behavioral decision making and translate them into a form that can be easily understood and used.</p>The second set of contributors are the people at my publisher&#x2014;FinancialTimes/Prentice Hall. Tim Moore, John Pierce, and Gary June believed in this project from its beginning and have provided me with terrific editorial and marketing support. Russ Hall provided feedback on how the manuscript could be improved, and Nicholas Radhuber was instrumental in managing the production process that turned my manuscript into the book you have in your hands.

Critical constructivism is an epistemological position that examines the process by which knowledge is socially constructed. Joe L. Kincheloe takes readers through the basic concepts and alerts them to the dangers of objectivism, reductionism, and the pathological views of self and world that emerge if students and educators are unaware of the construction of knowledge by dominant power interests.

Original. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Distinctions are often made between writers of "literature" and writers of popular fiction. The two seem to come together in David Morrell, author of <i>Lessons from a Lifetime of Writing</i>. Morrell writes thrillers--lots of them--including <i>First Blood</i>, which gave the world Rambo. But Morrell was also a longtime literature professor. He is as likely to quote E.M. Forster as he is Lawrence Block; Steve McQueen appears on the same page as Henry James. <i>Lessons</i> is a lovely examination of writing and the writing life. To read it is to put oneself in the company of a writerly raconteur. Toward the beginning of the book, he discusses Hemingway's bizarre upbringing, wartime experiences, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Toward the end, he reveals the secret to bribing the dispatchers and drivers who supply airport bookstores (a hint rarely, if ever before, reported in a writing book). With chapters devoted to plot, character, research, structure, viewpoint, and dialogue, Morrell covers all the basics. But this is less a how-to book than a written rendition of an intimate university writing workshop. "There are no inferior types of fiction," Morrell implores, "only inferior practitioners of them." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>David Morrell is the author of six New York Times best-sellers. His 15 novels have sold tens of millions of copies worldwide and have been translated into twenty-two languages.

He wasn&#x2019;t even Mark Twain then, but as Huck might have said, &#x201c;That ain&#x2019;t no matter.&#x201d; With the Civil War spreading across his native Missouri, twenty-five-year-old Samuel Clemens, suddenly out of work as a Mississippi riverboat pilot, gladly accepted his brother Orion&#x2019;s offer to join him in Nevada Territory, far from the crimsoned battlefields of war. </p><p>A rollicking, hilarious stagecoach journey across the Great Plains and over the Rocky Mountains was just the beginning of a nearly six-year-long odyssey that took Samuel Clemens from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Hawaii, with lengthy stopovers in Virginia City, Nevada, and San Francisco. By the time it was over, he would find himself reborn as Mark Twain, America&#x2019;s best-loved, most influential writer. The &#x201c;trouble,&#x201d; as he famously promised, had begun. </p><p>With a pitch-perfect blend of appreciative humor and critical authority, acclaimed literary biographer Roy Morris, Jr., sheds new light on this crucial but still largely unexamined period in Mark Twain&#x2019;s life. Morris carefully sorts fact from fiction&#x2014;never an easy task when dealing with Twain&#x2014;to tell the story of a young genius finding his voice in the ramshackle mining camps, boomtowns, and newspaper offices of the wild and woolly West, while the Civil War rages half a continent away. </p><p>With the frequent help of Twain&#x2019;s own words, Morris follows his subject on a winding journey of selfdiscovery filled with high adventure and low comedy, as Clemens/Twain dodges Indians and gunfighters, receives marriage advice from Brigham Young, burns down a mountain with a frying pan, gets claim-jumped by rival miners, narrowly avoids fighting a duel, hikes across the floor of an active volcano, becomes one of the first white men to try the ancient Hawaiian sport of surfing, and writes his first great literary success, &#x201c;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.&#x201d; </p><p><i>Lighting Out for the Territory </i>is a fascinating, even inspiring, account of how an unemployed riverboat pilot, would-be Confederate guerrilla, failed prospector, neophyte newspaper reporter, and parttime San Francisco aesthete reinvented himself as America&#x2019;s most famous and beloved writer. It&#x2019;s a good story, and mostly true&#x2014;with some stretchers thrown in for good measure.</p></p><p><b><b>CHAPTER 2</b></b> <p><b></b></p><b><b>A FINE PLEASURE TRIP</b></b> <p>BEFORE SAM AND ORION COULD GET TO NEVADA, they first had to reach St. Joseph, Missouri, the jumping-off point for the western frontier. On July 18, they went down to the St. Louis levee and boarded the <i>Sioux City</i>, a ramshackle packet boat, for a six-day trip up the Missouri River, the same river Sam Clemens had nearly been drafted to navigate for the Union Navy. Orion had left his wife, Mollie, and their five-year-old daughter, Jennie, with Mollie&#x2019;s parents in Keokuk; they would rejoin him in Carson City once he got properly situated. </p><p>The Missouri, the longest river on the North American continent, is a notoriously winding and treacherous waterway. Its three-thousand-mile course traces an elliptical loop from just above St. Louis to Fort Benton, Montana, a bluff-lined, ever-changing river that makes the Mississippi look tame in comparison. &#x201c;The Big Muddy,&#x201d; as it was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;called by travelers with no particular fondness for its turbid, dingy-brown appearance, was &#x201c;unpoetic and repulsive&#x2014;a stream of flowing mud studded with dead tree trunks and broken by bars,&#x201d; in the words of New York <i>Tribune</i> reporter Albert Richardson. It rose twice yearly, in April and June, when the snowmelt from the Nebraska prairies and the Rocky Mountains uprooted trees and sent them flying like javelins through the silt-thick water. &#x201c;I have seen nothing more frightful,&#x201d; French explorer Jacques Marquette observed in 1673, and in his travels he had seen a lot of frightening things. </p><p>In many ways, the Missouri was more dangerous than the Mississippi. Except for its annual flood time, the Missouri baked down during the summer to a trickle of quicksand-studded shallows beneath glowering treeless bluffs. Many pilots relied too readily on &#x201c;a wad of steam&#x201d; to get them through the occasional rapids or over sandbars. The consequences could be deadly; dozens of Missouri River steamers blew up each year from boiler explosions. On Good Friday, April 9, 1852, the paddle wheeler <i>Saluda</i> exploded near Lexington, Missouri. Ill-fated Captain Francis Belt, leaning against the ship&#x2019;s bell when the mishap occurred, found himself tumbling head over heels down a bluff several hundred yards inland, the bell clanging madly as it rolled downhill alongside him. The ship&#x2019;s safe, with a watchdog still chained to it, and an unlucky clerk who happened to be passing by, were flung two hundred yards ashore, and a local butcher had the abject misfortune to be dismembered by a flying boiler flue. In all, the bodies of more than one hundred <i>Saluda</i> crewmen and passengers were eventually recovered up and down the Lexington wharf, making it the worst single disaster in the river&#x2019;s disaster-strewn history. </p><p>The current trip was somewhat less perilous. Indeed, it was &#x201c;so dull and sleepy,&#x201d; recalled Twain, &#x201c;that it has left no more impression on my memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many days.&#x201d; Perhaps not, but he remembered enough about the trip to jab his professional judgment a decade later. The river, he said, presented &#x201c;a confused jumble of savage-looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with one wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and then retired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of sand-bars which we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out our crutches and sparred over.&#x201d; The boat might as well have traveled to St. Joseph by land, said Twain, since &#x201c;she was walking most of the time, anyhow.&#x201d; The boat&#x2019;s captain bragged that she was &#x201c;a bully boat,&#x201d; needing only more shear and a bigger wheel to make her perfect. Twain, with his jaundiced pilot&#x2019;s eye, thought the boat actually needed a pair of stilts, but he &#x201c;had the deep sagacity not to say so.&#x201d; Richardson, who had made a similar voyage upriver four years earlier, had no such compunction. &#x201c;Navigating the Missouri, at low water,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;is like putting a steamer upon dry land, and sending a boy ahead with a sprinkling pot.&#x201d; </p><p>The brothers arrived safely in St. Joseph on July 24 and went immediately to the business office of the Central Overland California &amp; Pike&#x2019;s Peak Express stagecoach line, where Sam purchased tickets for the pair of them, at $150 apiece. Counting boat fare, he was now four hundred dollars out of pocket, with only a vague promise from his brother&#x2014;he knew all about those&#x2014;to put him on the government payroll once they reached Nevada. In choosing as their carrier the COC&amp;PP, as it was known, the brothers had opted for the northernmost of the five established routes to the West Coast. (The Oregon Trail, which their route followed, diverged at Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and continued through the upper Northwest, but did not go through all the way to the coast.) Their itinerary followed the Little Blue River from Kansas into Nebraska, passing through Fort Kearny, then shadowed the Platte River to Cottonwood before cutting across the edge of Colorado and back into Nebraska to Fort Laramie, Wyoming, down to Fort Bridger, then to Salt Lake City, Utah, across the Great Salt Lake, and finally a straight shot across Nevada to Carson City. The trip was scheduled to take seventeen days and average a hundred miles per day. Passengers were expected to sleep sitting up inside the coach. It was a wearying prospect, but there was no other option; the first transcontinental railroad line would not be completed for another decade. </p><p>The fact that the stage line pulled into so many different forts along the way reflected the smoldering unrest, not yet a full-blown prairie fire, that was kindling within the various Plains Indian tribes whose ancestral homelands were being trampled daily by numberless thousands of white travelers. (On one day alone in August 1850, soldiers at Fort Laramie counted some 39,506 travelers rumbling westward aboard 9,927 wagons.) Among the tribes claiming territory abutting the COC&amp;PP route were the Cheyennes, Pawnees, Poncas, Arapahos, Utes, Paiutes, and Gosiutes. Most had attended the great 1851 peace parley at Fort Laramie, where representatives of the American government, in return for the right to build roads and army posts on their land, had promised to pay the tribes annuities of fifty thousand dollars each for the next fifty years. The parsimonious U.S. Senate soon cut the number down to ten years. </p><p>It took less than three years for trouble to flare. In August 1854, a young Miniconjou Sioux warrior named High Forehead, summering with his tribesmen outside Fort Laramie, shot a stray cow that had wandered into their camp and (according to the Indians) run amok. The cow belonged to a passing party of Danish immigrants, who complained to the fort&#x2019;s overworked commander, Lieutenant Hugh Fleming. Against his better judgment, Fleming sent Second Lieutenant John L. Grattan to investigate. Grattan, fresh out of West Point, was given to bragging that with ten good men he could defeat the entire Cheyenne nation. As it developed, he never got the chance (these were Sioux, anyway). On the morning of August 19, he rode out to arrest High Forehead. The warrior demurred. By the time negotiations had concluded, Grattan and his entire thirty-man force lay dead, Grattan&#x2019;s body by grim coincidence bristling with twenty-four arrows&#x2014;one for each year of his abruptly terminated life. </p><p>Sam Clemens may have heard about the Grattan massacre&#x2014;he was in St. Louis at the time&#x2014;and he certainly knew a garbled version of a second Indian massacre that had taken place two years later near Fort Kearny and involved a particularly luckless territorial secretary named Almon Whiting Babbitt. It was Babbitt&#x2019;s remarkable misfortune to be attacked twice by Cheyennes within the space of thirteen days. He survived the first attack by managing to be absent when a war party set upon his supply train and killed various of his companions. Forewarned but not forearmed, the secretary was attacked again two weeks later, apparently by a different group of Cheyennes. This time he was killed. In his subsequent account of the episode in <i>Roughing It</i>, Mark Twain mislocated Babbitt&#x2019;s attack by a good hundred miles and added: &#x201c;I was personally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who were wounded during that massacre, and barely escaped with their lives. . . . One of these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his system for nearly seven years after the massacre.&#x201d; According to Twain, Babbitt survived the massacre by crawling away on his hands and knees for forty hours, a singular feat since Babbitt was dead at the time. </p><p>With images of Indians dancing in his head (a drawing on page three of <i>Roughing It</i> shows the sleeping author innocently dreaming of Indians, wagon trains, buffalo hunts, steamboats, and gold mining, all lit by the rising sun), Sam climbed aboard a Concord stagecoach with Orion for the first leg of their journey. The Concord, named for the New Hampshire city where it was produced by the Abbot-Downing Company, was &#x201c;a great swinging and swaying . . . cradle on wheels.&#x201d; It weighed more than a ton, stood eight feet high, and could accommodate as many as twenty-one passengers&#x2014;nine seated inside and a dozen more hanging precariously from the roof. Drawn by six horses, the Concord&#x2019;s chief innovation was its flexible leather thoroughbraces, a pair of stiff, three-inch-thick leather strips that acted as primitive shock absorbers and produced the coach&#x2019;s characteristic rocking motion. A conductor rode beside the driver, functioning more or less as his counterpart did on a railroad train, overseeing the driver, passengers, and bags of mail entrusted to his care. The body of the stagecoach was painted English vermilion, with scenic pictures decorating the outside door panels and the likenes...</p>His 1872 <i>Roughing It</i> was Mark Twain's sanitized version of his trip west between 1861 and 1866, and Morris (<i>Fraud of the Century</i>) utilizes contemporaneous letters and diaries to separate fact from fiction about a watershed odyssey that transformed an itinerant printer, Mississippi riverboat pilot, and Confederate guerrilla into journalist, author, and stage performer. Unsuited to soldiering, fun-loving 25-year-old Samuel Clemens accompanied his older brother Orion cross-country by stagecoach from Missouri to Orion's patronage appointment in the newly created Nevada Territory. Clemens's encounters included notorious gunfighter Jack Slade, with whom he shared an innocuous cup of coffee, and the indomitable polygamist Mormon leader Brigham Young, whom he found kindly and dignified. At a lively Nevada newspaper, Clemens launched his professional writing career and took the name Mark Twain; at a San Francisco paper, he honed his satirical skills and began a complicated friendship with writer Bret Harte; in 1866, he wrote the first modern description of Hawaiian surfing in a Sacramento paper. This latest Twain bicentennial volume is a tale of a high-spirited, gifted humorist finding his voice in the rough-and-tumble of the Wild West&#x2014;an authoritative and engrossing slice of American history. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by the principles of Modernist art and Japanese aesthetics, Tunnard called for a "new technique" in garden design that emphasized an integration of form and purpose. "The functional garden avoids the extremes both of the sentimental expressionism of the wild garden and the intellectual classicism of the 'formal' garden," he wrote; "it embodies rather a spirit of rationalism and through an aesthetic and practical ordering of its units provides a friendly and hospitable milieu for rest and recreation."</p><p>Tunnard's magazine pieces were republished in book form as <i>Gardens in the Modern Landscape</i> in 1938, and a revised second edition was issued a decade later. Taken together, these articles constituted a manifesto for the modern garden, its influence evident in the work of such figures as Lawrence Halprin, Philip Johnson, and Edward Larrabee Barnes.</p><p>Long out of print, the book is here reissued in a facsimile of the 1948 edition, accompanied by a contextualizing foreword by John Dixon Hunt. <i>Gardens in the Modern Landscape</i> heralded a sea change in the evolution of twentieth-century design, and it also anticipated questions of urban sprawl, historic preservation, and the dynamic between the natural and built environments. Available once more to students, practitioners, and connoisseurs, it stands as a historical document and an invitation to continued innovative thought about landscape architecture.</p></p><p>Christopher Tunnard (1910-79) was born in Canada and lived and worked in England as a garden designer and landscape architect before emigrating to the United States. He taught in the Department of Architecture at Harvard and, shifting his focus after the Second World War, became head of the Department of City Planning at Yale. John Dixon Hunt is Professor Emeritus of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design and author of many books, most recently A World of Gardens and The Afterlife of Gardens, the latter also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Foreword to the Facsimile Edition<br>John Dixon Hunt</p><p><i>Gardens in the Modern Landscape, </i>first published as a book in 1938 and again ten years later, is an important moment in discussions and promotions of modern gardens and landscape architecture. A foreword for this reprint requires two things: to situate the text, for those who come to it for the first time and even for those who know it (since Tunnard's writing emerges from a whole cluster of interrelated concerns); and, secondly, to assess how it survives today, both as a historical document and as an invitation to continue thinking about landscape architecture.</p><p>What is reprinted here is the second edition of 1948 (to which page references are given, unless otherwise stated). The changes made to the first are, in fact, modest. The wording of the text itself remains almost the same in both editions, though the typeface is smaller and the images are now located in slightly different places on the page (so anyone citing pagination in these editions needs to specify which is being used). What gets altered textually in the second are mainly the substitution of a new and expanded "Foreword," the addition of a section on "Modern American Gardens" and, to conclude, an essay on "The Modern Garden" by Jospeh Hudnut, Dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Design, originally published in the <i>Bulletin</i> of the Garden Club of America. Tunnard's original section on "The Oriental Aesthetics" is now merged with the section on "Asymmetrical Garden Planning" (and the subsection heading deleted), he expands the footnote on "Sharawadgi" and inserts a new opening paragraph at the start of "A Solution for Today" (p. 143). The Contents page of the 1948 book itemizes the different subsections of the chapters, not just their titles; "The Case for Community Gardens" in 1938 becomes simply "Community Gardens" in 1948. There is no change in the bibliography (though doubtless the wartime restrictions on paper made new publications less likely).</p><p>But image clusters are augmented, with some examples appearing in different places (the result, perhaps, of having to devise new signatures for a newly set text). The plan of a garden arrangement by Garrett Eckbo at a Farm Security Administration camp in Texas is added on p. 142 in 1948, but with no commentary on it in the text. Some extra images are brought into the 1948 edition&#x2014;notably a cluster of examples on "Architect's Plants" (pp. 118-25), which replaced the planting plans for Gaulby (1938, pp. 118-22), and others at the end of the section on "Art and Ornament" that illustrate modern interpretations of traditional forms. The biggest change is the dropping of a long final section on garden decoration for Grottoes, the Garden House, Gates &amp; Fences, Garden Seats, Sculpture, and Conservancies (though two pages on "The Grotto" survived, now coming after "Reason and Romanticism" in 1948; a few of the other images from 1938 on garden decoration are used elsewhere in 1948).</p><p>More interesting, I believe, is less the movement, such as it is, between the two editions and the juggling of image placement than the transference of Tunnard's original articles in the <i>Architectural Review</i> (<i>AR</i>), printed between October 1937 to September 1938, into a book published in late December 1938 by the Architectural Press, an in-house extension of the <i>Review</i>. While articles can stand alone, having a certain self-sufficiency that does not ask readers to situate them within a larger argument, once those same articles are gathered into a book (even if the texts are unaltered) they acquire and need a more consistent argument that moves between and sustains them. Illustrations, too, function differently in articles from their inclusion in books (even if the images are identical); new images and certainly the different placement of them in a fresh edition respond to a reading of the whole book, because its readers will be able to consult the entirety of images rather than just the ones attached to a single article; this again should make the whole more coherent than the individual parts as well as enlarge its concept and impact (indeed, Tunnard does move clusters of images around in the two editions, perhaps to make a better impact; but he still allows many images in the book to do their own work, accompanied by captions but with no extended commentary in his main text).</p><p>Thus the transference of articles into a book does not always make for a coherent argument. While the 1948 edition, with Tunnard's self-criticisms and retractions, new additions, and the introduction of Hudnut's essay, is clearly something of an uneasy hold-all of rich and not always pursued ideas that Tunnard does not really do much about absorbing into a new structure, this is less true of the 1938 volume. Readers coming to it, especially without any sense that it emanated from a series of discrete articles and approaching it via the minimalist Contents page (which the 1948 edition would complicate with the insertions of many, not clearly adumbrated subheadings) will see the coherence. Even a reader like myself who has, as it were, done his homework can find 1938 a more sustained argument, and it is only our knowledge of Tunnard's new career in America after 1938 and the later version of 1948 that clouds our sense of what must have been, in 1938, an eloquent plea for modern gardens.</p><p>But the overriding issue throughout <i>Gardens in the Modern Landscape</i> (in both 1938 and 1948) and for its subsequent reception is surely Tunnard's understanding of modernist garden making and landscape architecture and his theoretical command of that material. This is in its turn allied to the dialogue between his garden practice and his ideas, for the practical work that he did in England largely petered out after he got to America in 1938 and certainly ceased when he moved to Yale as a regional planner in 1945.</p><p>It is not easy to adjudicate his modernist stance, for a variety of good reasons. From the very beginning, he was exploring, finding his way in European modernism, and meshing what he found there with his involvement in his English practice and his theoretical ideas on English modernism. Then, too, he was trying to find a place for garden making in landscape architecture, in modernist <i>architectural</i> theory, which was what he largely relied on, as well as in other competing concerns, such as his strong historical interest, community planning, and new housing. What also complicates these judgments is that Tunnard wrote the <i>AR</i> articles and published the book in England, while maintaining a freelance role, then promptly left to pursue a career in university teaching in America. Joining Harvard's GSD in 1938, he eventually (after a spell in the Canadian armed forces&#x2014;he was a Canadian by birth) moved to Yale, where he established himself as an important regional designer and writer. These stops and changes don't make for a smooth intellectual trajectory, especially when you are&#x2014;as was Tunnard&#x2014;both curious and inquisitive and at the same time learning how to negotiate modernism in Europe and North America during a crucial period of both modernism itself and landscape architecture.</p><p>People tended to judge Tunnard's book then (and still do nowadays) by where they locate him in his career&#x2014;as a landscape architect or later as a planner&#x2014;and/or the person who is writing about him&#x2014;are they writing about him in England or America? The British journal <i>Landscape Design</i>, for example, said he had been "swamped by the American system" (whatever <i>that</i> was supposed to be), and as late as 1989 Jane Brown's <i>Art and Architecture of English Gardens</i> wrote about his work from a wholly British perspective, which given his later career in planning might seem plausible as he seemed to have lost touch with garden art. Many American landscape architects today, however, would consider his appeal to English landscape gardening of the late eighteenth century hopelessly irrelevant, and his continuing pleas for the lawn (albeit "in this country," i.e., Britain; see p. 67) offend large parts of the United States where chemicals are often used to keep grass immaculate and water is in short supply.</p><p>So we need to look at these different moments in his career as well as at its importance today. The main changes for the 1948 edition are crucial, but sit uneasily with the unchanged remainder of the 1938 text. The one and a quarter pages of the Foreword (pp. 5-6) in the first edition were short and straightforward. He argued that tradition and "experiment" are easily reconciled and that, given that the great ages of garden art were in Italy, France, and, by the eighteenth century, England, the "style for our own time . . . will not be very different from the humanized landscape tradition" of the latter. Since the nineteenth century had "debased all these traditions" to a "medley of styles," or maybe "formed the roots of the Modern movement . . . now developing," and since many eighteenth-century garden landscapes were "disappearing," the need was to create a new landscape for the twentieth century. This seemed to imply that a "style for our time" necessitated an emphasis on planning and a focus on "houses, factories, shops and places of amusement . . . the street, the park and the rationally-planned community" (1938, p. 5). He ended with the confidence that a clearer picture of what a garden is, or should be, would emerge to satisfy the "complex needs of modern society." The language is generalized, even for a Foreword: "style," a term he often used in the rest of the work, does not begin to explain how the usage of this term can appeal to "today."</p><p>The four-page 1948 Foreword is more embattled and also a little defensive. He begins by addressing the "conclusions" that have been reached in the intervening ten years, though many people have been engaged in "other occupations" (the war, but perhaps his own move to America and toward planning). He continues to insist that eighteenth-century English landscaping was right and admired its transference to North America; that its emphasis on locality, on observing "genius of place," was still necessary. He backtracks slightly on his distaste for nineteenth-century garden art, saying now that it was not all "mere essays in copyism" but productive of new forms and expressions. His attitude toward modernism has also changed as a result of "seeing more examples"&#x2014;an "accumulation of acquired knowledge" certainly trumps "intuitiveness"! Citing a "manifesto" that he says he authored jointly with Jean Canneel-Claes, he now acknowledges that he would himself need to modify their original claim that past "philosophy" or landscape "origins" can be ignored (this modification thus resisting out-and-out "modernism"). He cites an American professor who wanted "less history and more modern things" in Tunnard's next book, and he rebuts it by quoting Geoffrey Scott. Hence, his renewed call for "pleasing variety" in design that allows him to insist again on Sharawadgi. Finally, he refuses to accept that architects and planners can "help to build a better society"; they "must," however (and this seems muddled), go into community planning, because, while they may shape a plan, "they should not try to dictate its final <i>form</i>" (my italics). He then denigrates (p. 7) the work of a host of technocrats, from anti-intellectualism to organic plantsmanship. His own skills must honor usefulness, aesthetic qualities, good materials, and the wishes of the client.</p><p>The three ideas he expounds in the pages that follow in the center of the book have to do with functionalism, empathy, and aesthetics. He discusses the first in "Towards a New Technique" (pp. 69-80), the second while exploring Japanese garden art under the rubric of asymmetrical garden planning (pp. 81-92), and the third in the section "Art and Ornament" (pp. 93-98). His emphasis upon functionalism espouses simplicity and an un-Victorian and Edwardian sparseness and insists on its fitness for the purpose envisaged and sees the obvious need to ensure that garden design responds to contemporary activities (tennis and swimming pools, not croquet lawns) as well as "traditional elements." The oriental legacy had introduced "asymetrical garden planning" into the eighteenth century, and what modern design now needs is to seize an "occult" balance&#x2014;an "interplay of background and foreground, height and depth, motion and rest"&#x2014;that is exemplified by the "spiritual quality in inanimate objects" that Tunnard finds in Japan; it is this "unity of the habitation within its environment" that elicits one of Tunnard's more eloquent and thoughtful meditations on how we might connect with a garden's forms.</p><p>On aesthetics, he first begins by deleting a section on beauty, presumably because he now suspects its analogy is awkward, as if bread cannot be <i>both</i> nourishing and pleasing and as if bread and gardens have the same function. But he continues to insist, as he did in the very first paragraph of his book, that the garden is like "an aesthetic composition" that needs to be maintained in the face of a naturalistic confusion that gardens ought to imitate nature. This confusion he attributes to the fuzzy thinking on the part of amateur English gentlemen and ladies who think of landscaping as a "hobby" (p. 11). While he agrees that it is hard to accept that the garden <i>is</i> a work of art and needs to be seen as a mediated activity, he proposes that the best of modern sculpture can be invoked to rethink garden ornament: both <i>objets trouv�es</i> and the ancient stones and monoliths of ancient Britain (which can somehow be referenced in those objects). These were of especial interest to Paul Nash, who provided Tunnard with a photograph of standing stones in Cornwall and one of whose "objects" was illustrated and discussed (pp. 95 and 100). Tunnard argued that a garden designer needed to "co-operate with Nature" rather than "becoming a slave to her demands" (p. 95). The modern designer cannot be "bound by the conventional necessity for picturesque representation, and looks upon the imitation of Nature as a long-perpetuated artistic fraud" (p. 80). We may sense here a need that recalls the earliest historical objections to "Capability" Brown's work that it seemed no different from common fields and allies it with an ecological fundamentalism: landscape architecture should look like landscape architecture and be, in some way, distinguishable from what surrounds it that is not.</p><p>It would be hard to see Tunnard as a theoretician. His own education in Europe had a touch of Autolycus in <i>A Winter's Tale</i>, a "snapper-up of unconsidered trifles." Yet what he gathered was not unconsidered, only piecemeal. He garnered ideas on Japanese gardens from Percy S. Cane, for whom he worked between 1932 and 1935, but he may also have seen Japanese examples in his early years growing up in California. He also admired the work of the potter Bernard Leach, who had studied in Japan and returned to practice in Cornwall with a Japanese potter.

While there, he launched <em>The Eighth Day</em>, a tale set in a mining town in southern Illinois about two families blasted apart by the apparent murder of one father by the other. The miraculous escape of the accused killer, John Ashley, on the eve of his execution and his flight to freedom triggers a powerful story tracing the fate of his and the victim's wife and children. At once a murder mystery and a philosophical story, <em>The Eighth Day</em> is a "suspenseful and deeply moving" (<em>New York Times</em>) work of classic stature that has been hailed as a great American epic.</p><p>One of America's most acclaimed and beloved writers, Thornton Wilder (1897-1975) was a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner for his acclaimed novel <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i> and his full-length dramas <i>Our Town</i> and <i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i>.

But these New York transplants and Holocaust survivors all still had plenty of living, laughing and loving to do, as strikingly portrayed in <i>Shtetl in the Sun</i>, which features previously unseen photographs documenting South Beach&#x2019;s once-thriving and now-vanished Jewish community&#x2015;a project that American photographer Andy Sweet (1953&#x2013;82) began in 1977 after receiving his MFA from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and a driving passion until his tragic death. Sweet&#x2019;s photos capture this community&#x2019;s daily rhythms in all their beach-strolling, klezmer-dancing glory. &#x201c;They were strong, humorous, and beautiful images,&#x201d; fellow photographer Mary Ellen Mark, who worked closely with Sweet, remarked after his death. The book includes a foreword by award-winning Miami arts journalist Brett Sokol and an introductory essay by National Book Award finalist and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Lauren Groff.</p></p><p>Under cerulean skies, at the shores of the azure Atlantic, in the shade of tall, green palm trees, nearly vibrating in the hot Miami sun, the photographer&#x2019;s subjects&#x2015;aged but resilient, a new breed of pioneers in a new kind of frontier&#x2015;were of this country just as much as Shore&#x2019;s roadside budget motels and gas stations, or Eggleston&#x2019;s diners and long-finned cars.

In determining if a judicial opinion is good or bad, he explores the possibility of cultural criticism, the nature of conceptual language, the character of economic and legal discourse, and the appropriate expectations for critical and analytic writing. White employs his unique approach by analyzing individual cases involving the Fourth Amendment of the United States constitution and demonstrates how a judge translates the facts and the legal tradition, creating a text that constructs a political and ethical community with its readers.<br> <br> "White has given us not just a novel answer to the traditional jurisprudential questions, but also a new way of reading and evaluating judicial opinions, and thus a new appreciation of the liberty which they continue to protect."&#x2014;Robin West, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <br> "James Boyd White should be nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court, solely on the strength of this book. . . . <i>Justice as Translation</i> is an important work of philosophy, yet it is written in a lucid, friendly style that requires no background in philosophy. It will transform the way you think about law."&#x2014;Henry Cohen, <i>Federal Bar News &amp; Journal</i><br> <br> "White calls us to rise above the often deadening and dreary language in which we are taught to write professionally. . . . It is hard to imagine equaling the clarity of eloquence of White's challenge. The apparently effortless grace of his prose conveys complex thoughts with deceptive simplicity."&#x2014;Elizabeth Mertz, <i>Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities</i><br> <br> "<i>Justice as Translation</i>, like White's earlier work, provides a refreshing reminder that the humanities, despite the pummelling they have recently endured, can be humane."&#x2014;Kenneth L. Karst, <i>Michigan Law Review</i></p></p><p>A pioneer in the law and humanities, James Boyd White here develops a way of criticizing the work of judges that he then uses as the basis for a more general method of cultural criticism. White argues that analytic philosophy and economics are inadequate as modes of legal criticism. He turns instead to the practice of translation to expose the intellectual and ethical center of legal experience and to connect it with other forms of cultural action. The unified vision of law and cultural process defined in this book provides a ground both for the criticism of law and for a general understanding of the ways in which we negotiate our identities and build our communities through language.James Boyd White is the Hart Wright Professor of Law, professor of English language and literature, and adjunct professor of classical studies at the University of Michigan.</p><h2>The Isma&#39;ilis: Their History and Doctrines</h2><p>This authoritative book traces the history and doctrinal development of the Isma&#39;ili movement from its origins to the present day, a period of twelve centuries. It is the first comprehensive synthesis of the scattered results of modern scholarship on the subject and it draws on numerous primary and secondary texts, and particularly a number of private Isma&#39;ili manuscripts that have recently become available. All the major phases of Isma&#39;ili history are covered. From the pre-Fatimid period, Dr. Daftary conducts a detailed investigation through the Fatimid &#34;golden age&#34; and the troubled Musta&#39;li-Tayyibi period up to the spiritual and physical strengths of Mizari Isma&#39;ilism in Syria and Iran before the onslaught of the Mongols. The last part of the book discusses the modern developments of Isma&#39;ilism, particularly in Iran and on the Indian subcontinent. For all students of Islamic and Middle Eastern history this volume will serve as the most definitive account yet of the history of the Isma&#39;ilis and their movement.</p><p>Scattered across the globe, the Isma&#39;ilis constitute the second largest Shi&#39;i community in the Muslim World. This study traces their history and doctrinal developments from their origins to the present day over a period of twelve centuries."Daftary's work is as clear and comprehensible in style as a book on this subject could be and makes very agreeable reading, with nuggets of valuable information in every chapter." Middle East Journal<br><br>"This is an impressive survey of real weight in both its scholarship and physical size....If it is primarily a historical work, Daftary has not ignored the doctrinal development of the Isma'ilis. All the major medieval authors, like al-Hamidi, al-Kirmani and al-Sijistani, have been consulted, as well as many secondary sources, and doctrinal developments are placed next to the historical and political. The resulting book is likely to become a standard text for all students and scholars of one of Shi'ite Islam's most fascinating and complex branches." Ian Richard Netton, The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"...truly an impressive accomplishment as well as a rewarding and pleasant read for anyone even remotely interested in Islamic history. Without a doubt, it will deservedly remain the standard scholarly work on things Ism^D-a^D-il^D-i for some time to come." James E. Lindsay,Journal of Near Eastern Studies</p><h2>Schiller As Philosopher: A Re-Examination</h2><p>Fred Beiser, renowned as one of the world's leading historians of German philosophy, presents a brilliant new study of Friedrich von Schiller (1759-1805), rehabilitating him as a philosopher worthy of serious attention. Beiser shows, in particular, that Schiller's engagement with Kant is far more subtle and rewarding than is often portrayed. Promising to be a landmark in the study of German thought, <em>Schiller as Philosopher</em> will be compulsory reading for any philosopher, historian, or literary scholar engaged with the key developments of this fertile period.<br></p><p>Frederick Beiser is at Syracuse University, New York.<br>This is an important, scholarly attempt to evaluate Schiller as a philosopher. It forges new understandings of his stance on such essential subjects as beauty, aesthetics, and the theory of drama. Beiser (Syracuse Univ.) takes a chronological view, including letters, essays in periodicals, and even the footnotes that accompany essential documents. He includes a strong bibliography and two appendixes, one about rhetoric and philosophy in Schiller's essays and the other about the neo-Kantian interpretation of Schiller. Accessible to readers without knowledge of German, this study is particularly valuable because it revisits the accepted wisdom about Schillers' relationship to such significant philosophers as Fichte and Rousseau. [Beiser] calls for greater attention to primary sources as scholars continue to evaluate Schiller's philosophical contribution to has age and our own. --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Legends in Limestone: Lazarus, Gislebertus, and the Cathedral of Autun</h2><p>Whereas twelfth-century pilgrims flocked to the church of St-Lazare in Autun to visit the relics of its patron saint, present-day pilgrims journey there to admire its superb sculpture, said to have been created by the artist Gislebertus whose name is inscribed above one of the church doors. These two cults, of sculptor and of saint, form points of departure and arrival for Linda Seidel's study.<br><br><i>Legends in Limestone</i> reveals how "Gislebertus, sculptor" was discovered and subsequently sanctified over the course of the last century. Seidel makes a compelling case for the identification of the name with an ancestor of the local ducal family, invoked for his role in the acquisition of the precious relics. With the aid of evidence drawn from the richly carved decoration of the building, she demonstrates how medieval visitors would have read a different holy narrative in the church fabric, one that constructed before their eyes an account of their patron saint's life.<br><br><i>Legends in Limestone,</i> an absorbing study of one of France's most revered medieval monuments, provides fresh insights into modern and medieval interpretive practices.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Applied Math for Food Service</h2><p><p> <b> </b> <i>A Handbook for Food Service Costing</i> acquaints readers with the basics of food cost controls through practical techniques useful in real-world situations. <b> </b> This book presents the mathematical skills necessary for food service professionals through a common sense, step-by-step approach and real life situations such as yield tests, the calculation of recipe costs, and the use of food cost percentages.

These essays, many of which have become classics, explore a wide variety of subjects: images of mothers, fathers, and children in eighteenth century art and culture; the image of the female nude in the context of the modern museum; and the role of modern art criticism in today&#39;s art market. Other essays examine the contexts in which art is seen, taught, and made. Whatever her theme, Duncan treats art as a working part of a larger social reality and a pathway to understanding its deepest tensions, fears, and desires. A final section of this book is devoted to the life and collected critical writings of Cheryl Bernstein, a fictitious critic created by Duncan as parody, but who was taken as a real and eventually influential, critic.</p><p>The Aesthetics of Power gathers together the key articles and essays by Carol Duncan, one of the pioneers of a new social-political approach to art history and criticism, and one of the strongest feminist voices to emerge in the 1970s and &#39;80s.</p><h2>Reading with Patrick: A Teacher, a Student, and a Life-Changing Friendship</h2><p><b>"Penetrating, haunting ... In all of the literature addressing education, race, poverty, and criminal justice, there has been nothing quite like&nbsp;<i>Reading with Patrick</i>."--</b><b>James Forman, Jr. and Arthur Evenchik,&nbsp;</b><b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Recently graduated from Harvard University, Michelle Kuo arrived in the rural town of Helena, Arkansas, as a Teach for America volunteer, bursting with optimism and drive. But she soon encountered the jarring realities of life in one of the poorest counties in America, still disabled by the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. In this stirring memoir, Kuo, the child of Taiwanese immigrants, shares the story of her complicated but rewarding mentorship of one student, Patrick Browning, and his remarkable literary and personal awakening.&nbsp;Convinced she can make a difference in the lives of her teenaged students, Michelle Kuo puts her heart into her work, using quiet reading time and guided writing to foster a sense of self in students left behind by a broken school system. Though Michelle loses some students to truancy and even gun violence, she is inspired by some such as Patrick. Fifteen and in the eighth grade, Patrick begins to thrive under Michelle's exacting attention. However, after two years of teaching, Michelle feels pressure from her parents and the draw of opportunities outside the Delta and leaves Arkansas to attend law school.<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Then, on the eve of her law-school graduation, Michelle learns that Patrick has been jailed for murder. Feeling that she left the Delta prematurely and determined to fix her mistake, Michelle returns to Helena and resumes Patrick's education--even as he sits in a jail cell awaiting trial. Every day for the next seven months they pore over classic novels, poems, and works of history. Little by little, Patrick grows into a confident, expressive writer and a dedicated reader galvanized by the works of Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Walt Whitman, W. S. Merwin, and others.&nbsp;<b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;In this powerful memoir that "avoids the education-as-savior clich�," as James Forman, Jr. and Arthur Evenchik write,&nbsp;Kuo is herself transformed as she contends with the legacy of slavery and&nbsp;&nbsp;he questions of what constitutes a&nbsp;"good" life and what the privileged owe to those with bleaker prospects.<i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>&nbsp;</i><b><b>"Readers witness the transformative power of their moving lessons in both literature and life."--<i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i></b></b><b><b><i></i></b></b><b><b><i></i></b></b><b><b><i></i></b></b><b><b></b></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i><b><i>"</i>Anyone interested in questions of pedagogy, racism, and incarceration in America, not to mention literary criticism, will be enthralled by this book ...

By the end of the 19th-century, a new generation of photographers was emerging, many of whom studied in a system that was integrating Western ideas into Japanese culture. As Japan made the transition into an industrialized economy, artists began to establish themselves in the international arena. The pre-war modern photography movement in Japan flourished with a rich exchange of ideas and information as aritsts studied in Europe and international artistic developments were explored through exhibitions and publications in Japan. "Modern Photography in Japan: 1915-1940"will present over 80 images, many of which have never been seen before in the United States, by 35 photographers whose work evolved from a pictorialist tradition to the beginning of a modernist aesthetic. <p>Essay by Ryuichi Kaneko.

His interest, unique at the time, was twofold: to assess the art as creative work, and to use it as a way of studying mental illness. Prinzhorn's Collection attracted the attention of many artists, including Paul Klee and Oskar Schlemmer, but by the 1930s, when the Nazis declared such work "degenerate," the Collection fell into disrepair. Only in recent decades has it been properly restored and made available for a wider public.<br><br>This catalog accompanied the first exhibition in Britain to foreground the Prinzhorn Collection as a whole. The works represented in these pages defy simple categorization: The range is extraordinary and the art's startling sophistication, inventiveness, and beauty inevitably prompt comparison with such artists as Max Ernst and the Surrealists and with Jean Dubuffet.<br><br>Three texts are immensely helpful in providing an understanding of the Collection's importance: Bettina Brand-Claussen deals with the Collection's origins within the changing culture of postwar Europe; Inge J�di offers a meditation on the ethical, interpretative, and aesthetic questions in presenting the Collection; and Caroline Douglas sets Prinzhorn's endeavor within a broader historical and intellectual context.<br><br>Questions surrounding art and madness are endlessly fascinating, no more so than today, as science moves to unlock the mysteries of the mind. The Prinzhorn Collection will do much to inspire continuing debate on the links between creativity, rationality, and illness.</p><p>&#34;The pictures reproduced in this excellent book are a feast for the hungry imagination . . . and form a stunning tribute to the creative spirit.

Because all relations with the Japanese are influenced by kata, the key to dealing with the Japanese in personal or business matters requires knowing how and when to induce or compel them to break the kata and behave in a non-Japanese way.</i></i><b>Kenneth G.

Critics demonized Ryan. For opponents of capital punishment, however, Ryan became an instant hero whose decision was seen as a signal moment in the "new abolitionist" politics to end killing by the state.</p><br><p> In this compelling and timely work, Austin Sarat provides the first book-length work on executive clemency. He turns our focus from questions of guilt and innocence to the very meaning of mercy. Starting from Ryan's controversial decision, <i>Mercy on Trial</i> uses the lens of executive clemency in capital cases to discuss the fraught condition of mercy in American political life. Most pointedly, Sarat argues that mercy itself is on trial. Although it has always had a problematic position as a form of "lawful lawlessness," it has come under much more intense popular pressure and criticism in recent decades. This has yielded a radical decline in the use of the power of chief executives to stop executions.</p><br><p> From the history of capital clemency in the twentieth century to surrounding legal controversies and philosophical debates about when (if ever) mercy should be extended, Sarat examines the issue comprehensively. In the end, he acknowledges the risks associated with mercy--but, he argues, those risks are worth taking.</p></p><p>2006 James Boyd White Prize, Association for the Study of Law, Culture, and the Humanities<p>"Today, more than ever, Americans are asking questions about what role, if any, the death penalty should have in modern law enforcement.

This is reflected more particularly in the flower industry, where the cost of collecting the blossoms delivered to the factories has gone up year after year, so much so that most flowers with the possible exception of Mimosa, have reached a cost price which has compelled the perfumer to either reduce his purchases of absolutes and concretes, or alternatively to substitute them from a cheaper source, or even to discontinue their use. This development raises an important and almost insoluble problem for the perfumer, who is faced with the necessity of trying to keep unchanged the bouquet of his fragrances, and moreover, to ensure no loss of strength and diffusiveness. Of course, this problem applies more especially to the adjustment of formulae for established perfumes, because in every new creation the present high cost of raw materials receives imperative con� sideration before the formula is approved.</p><p><strong>`</strong>Poucher has been a standard reference since it was first published in 1923.

Assuming markets to be generally in some state of equilibrium, it is asked under what circumstances such equilibrium is possible. The fundamental mathematical tools used to address this concern are fixed point theorems: the conditions under which sets of assumptions have a solution. This book gives the reader access to the mathematical techniques involved and goes on to apply fixed point theorems to proving the existence of equilibria for economics and for co-operative and noncooperative games. Special emphasis is given to economics and games in cases where the preferences of agents may not be transitive. The author presents topical proofs of old results in order to further clarify the results. He also proposes fresh results, notably in the last chapter, that refer to the core of a game without transitivity. This book will be useful as a text or reference work for mathematical economists and graduate and advanced undergraduate students.</p><p>An introduction to fixed point theory, a body of mathematical techniques for proposing conditions under which sets of assumptions (underlying economic models) have solutions."The book cleanly separates the mathematical theory from the economic applications.

Rather, the contributors assess the extent to which the kind of phenomenological investigation Husserl initiated favors the construction of a scientific theory of cognition, particularly in contributing to specific contemporary theories either by complementing or by questioning them. What clearly emerges is that Husserlian phenomenology cannot become instrumental in developing cognitive science without undergoing a substantial transformation. Therefore, the central concern of this book is not only the progress of contemporary theories of cognition but also the reorientation of Husserlian phenomenology.</p> <p>Because a single volume could never encompass the numerous facets of this dual aim, the contributors focus on the issue of naturalization. This perspective is far-reaching enough to allow for the coverage of a great variety of topics, ranging from general structures of intentionality, to the nature of the founding epistemological and ontological principles of cognitive science, to analyses of temporality and perception and the mathematical modeling of their phenomenological description.</p> <p>This book, then, is a collective reflection on the possibility of utilizing a naturalized Husserlian phenomenology to contribute to a scientific theory of cognition that fills the explanatory gap between the phenomenological mind and brain.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Every student of cognition will somewhere in [Naturalizing Phenomenology] find something new and interesting.&#x201d;&#x2014;APA Review of BooksJean Petitot is Directeur d&#39;Etudes at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris.

But the real central character of the novel is the city of Petersburg at the beginning of the twentieth century, caught in the grip of political agitation and social unrest. Intertwining the worlds of history and myth, and parading a cast of unforgettable characters, Petersburg is a story of apocalypse and redemption played out through family dysfunction, conspiracy and murder.</p><p>Andrei Bely (whose real name was Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev), was born in 1880 into a family of illustrious intellectuals.

For over a century, non-Jews and Jews alike have tried to identify who they were--first applying the methods of physical anthropology and more recently of population genetics. <br><br> In <em>Legacy</em>, Harry Ostrer, a medical geneticist and authority on the genetics of the Jewish people, explores not only the history of these efforts, but also the insights that genetics has provided about the histories of contemporary Jewish people. Much of the book is told through the lives of scientific pioneers. We meet Russian immigrant Maurice Fishberg; Australian Joseph Jacobs, the leading Jewish anthropologist in fin-de-si�cle Europe; Chaim Sheba, a colorful Israeli geneticist and surgeon general of the Israeli Army; and Arthur Mourant, one of the foremost cataloguers of blood groups in the 20th century. As Ostrer describes their work and the work of others, he shows that to look over the genetics of Jewish groups, and to see the history of the Diaspora woven there, is truly a marvel. Here is what happened as the Jews migrated to new places and saw their numbers wax and wane, as they gained and lost adherents and thrived or were buffeted by famine, disease, wars, and persecution. Many of these groups--from North Africa, the Middle East, India--are little-known, and by telling their stories, Ostrer brings them to the forefront at a time when assimilation is literally changing the face of world Jewry.<br><br> A fascinating blend of history, science, and biography, <em>Legacy</em> offers readers an entirely fresh perspective on the Jewish people and their history. It is as well a cutting-edge portrait of population genetics, a field which may soon take its place as a pillar of group identity alongside shared spirituality, shared social values, and a shared cultural legacy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harry Ostrer, MD</strong> is Professor of Pathology and Genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Director of Genetic and Genomic Laboratories at Montefiore Medical Center.

William Blake said of them, &#34;Certainly, the very best letters that ever were published.&#34; This book selects letters from every part of his life and give insight into the workings of his suicidal mind, desolate in its conviction of total abandonment by God. As a whole, the letters reveal Cowper&#39;s extraordinary skill as a writer of letters, his personality in all its guises, his deep-seated commitment to friendship, his fine critical sensiblility, and his interest in landscape, gardens, pets, and ordinary village lives and events. All the letters are printed in complete form, following the texts of the editors&#39; acclaimed five-volume edition.</p><p><br>"Cowper was one of the most engaging correspondents of the 18th century, and his letters shine with the lucid, simple, and precise style that characterizes the best of his poetry....This selection...admirably evinces the quality of the poet's letters....The volume is beautifully edited and printed."--<em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br>"An excellently chosen and eminently portable one that will serve well to introduce readers to the delights of Cowper's letters.

They are larger and more complex, have great strategic value to their sponsors, and their users are busier and less forgiving. Designers, information architects, and web site managers are required to juggle vast amounts of information, frequent changes, new technologies, and sometimes even multiple objectives, making some web sites look like a fast-growing but poorly planned city-roads everywhere, but impossible to navigate. Well-planned informationarchitecture has never been as essential as it is now.<i>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</i>, 2nd Edition, shows you how to blend aesthetics and mechanics for distinctive, cohesive web sites that work. Most books on web development concentrate on either the graphics or the technical issues of a site. This book focuses on the framework that holds the two together.This edition contains more than 75% new material. You'll find updated chapters on organization, labeling, navigation, and searching; and a new chapter on thesauri, controlled vocabularies and metadata will help you understand the interconnectedness of these systems. The authors have expanded the methodology chapters to include a more interdisciplinary collection of tools and techniques. They've also complemented the top-down strategies of the first edition with bottom-up approaches that enable distributed, emergent solutions.A whole new section addresses the opportunities and challenges of practicing information architecture, while another section discusses how that work impacts and is influenced by the broader organizational context. New case studies provide models for creating enterprise intranet portals and online communities. Finally, you'll find pointers to a wealth of essential information architecture resources, many of which did not exist a few years ago.By applying the principles outlined in this completely updated classic, you'll build web sites and intranets that are easier to navigate and appealing to your users, as well as scalable and simple to maintain. <i>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</i>, 2nd Edition is a treasure trove of ideas and practical advice for anyone involved in building or maintaining a large, complex web site or intranet.</p></p><p>Praise for Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, 2nd Edition <p>"It's been well worth the wait! This much expanded second version provides a holistic perspective on information architecture &#x2013; something that wasn't possible earlier on when the concept was just beginning to be raised in the web space. It will be the starting place and the core reference resource for practicing and future information architects, as well as their managers. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their ideas become real, and most importantly, of value to their end-user community." -- Mary Lee Kennedy, Microsoft </p><p>"In the first edition, Lou and Peter examined the emergence of a new species of technical professional -- the IA.

The 2nd Edition of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web is the cure." -- John S. Rhodes, WebWord.com -- Industrial Strength Usability </p><p>"The world will be a better place when web designers read this book. It's smart, funny, and artfully distills years of the authors' hard-won experience. Information Architecture is unlike any other book on web design I know in that it tackles political/organizational challenges as well as content, structure and user interface. This is not design-lite, but a deep treatment of fundamental issues of information presentation that advances the state of the art. Light years ahead of the competition." -- Bonnie Nardi, co-author of Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart, MIT Press, 1999. </p><p>"If you are developing large-scale Web sites with a complex information architecture, this book will explain everything you need.

Impressionable, innocent, enthusiastic, eager to learn, and all different. In fact, if you believe that all children are identical&#x2014;with the same interests, abilities, and size&#x2014;then<i>Children Moving</i> is not the book for you. The authors of <i>Children Moving</i>, however, recognize that each child is unique. One size does not fit all! Thus,<i>Children Moving</i> guides you in the process of learning to teach a curriculum that is differentiated for a range of skill abilities and fitness levels. If all children were the same, we would be able to package a curriculum with the same games and the same gymnastic stunts and dances you would do with all of the children as if they were identical.<i>Children Moving</i>, on the other hand, introduces you to the reflective approach&#x2014;a process of teaching that provides the background for you to adapt, adjust, and modify lessons so they are interesting and worthwhile for all of the children you teach&#x2014;from the lowest to the highest skill and fitness levels. The ultimate goal, of course, is to guide youngsters in the process of becoming physically active for a lifetime.<br><br>The lesson plans to accompany <i>Children Moving</i>, <i>On the Move: Lesson Plans for Children Moving</i>, are now available on the CREATE platform as an ExpressBook.

The beginning of God&#39;s story of his interactions with humanity is found in the very first words of the Bible. In the beginning God created. From the start God was present. He was at work. However, in the freshness of a new world where the first man and woman walked and talked with God, sin slithered in, marring creation forever. But the God who hung every star in place and laid every grain of sand upon the shore had, from the beginning, a plan. The whole of Scripture, and indeed the whole of history, is unveiled within the seeds of Genesis. It will be many years before we see the fruit of those seeds, but they are not years of dormancy. Throughout the world and within individual lives, God is actively working to redeem his creation. In Genesis we see him form covenants, bestow blessings, test faithfulness and turn evil intentions into a greater good---all for the purpose of one day redeeming the people he created in his image. It&#39;s a work that will continue until the end of time, but the beginnings for all of it are found in Genesis. The Beginning 1 In the be ginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was a form less and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 3 And God said, &#39;Let there be light,&#39; and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called t he light &#39;day,&#39; and the darkness he called &#39;night.&#39; And there was evening, and there was morning---the first day. 6 And God said, &#39;Let there be an expanse between the waters to sep a rate water from water.&#39; 7 So God made the expanse and a 2 Or possibly became 1 Author: Moses. Audience: The people of Israel. Date: Between 1446 and 1406 B.C. Setting: The area called the Middle East today. Verse to Remember: In the beginning God . . . (1:1) 13 LOUIS SULLIVAN, the inventor of the modern skyscraper, said, &#39;The tall building . . . should be a proud and soaring thing that makes a powerful appeal to the architectural imagination.&#39; Today, many women embody the same spirit of pride and selfsuffi ciency that is represented in the lofty towers that make up our cities. We focus on personal perfection. Many women seek the pinnacle of age-defying beauty through creams, procedures or surgeries. Some become obsessed with fashion or feel that they must conform to some media-driven image. Over time, it becomes easier and easier to build monuments to ourselves. After all, as the famous ad says, &#39;I&#39;m worth it.&#39; The builders of the tower of Babel shared a key aspect of Sullivan&#39;s vision of the tall building: pride. And they had one purpose: to build a name for themselves. They wanted to claim glory that rightly belonged to God---after all, they were worth it. The longing to climb higher than God didn&#39;t begin in Babel. Before time began Lucifer said, &#39;I will raise my throne above the stars of God&#39; (Isaiah 14:13). It didn&#39;t end with Babel, either. The pyramids of Egypt proclaim the power of the rulers buried beneath them. Many lives were lost in the building of the pyramids, &#39;collateral damage&#39; to the princes who built them. Often Egyptian slaves were killed when their masters died and were buried alongside them. But just as the Egyptian kings sacrificed everything to their own legacy, women often sacrifice the good of those around them for fleeting recognition, not to mention the humble spirit God desires. The rulers of ancient Egypt were not all-powerful---they died the deaths of mere men. Don&#39;t be deceived, your soul will not be saved by flawless skin or the perfect career any more than the towering mountains of stone raised over the mummies of kings saved them. What do you take pride in? What keeps you from glorifying God? Has your focus become self-absorbed? Have you become self-glorifying? The solution is simple: Whatever is keeping you from God, give it to him for his glory. Let your relationship with Jesus be the source of your significance. When you humble yourself before God, you&#39;ll be lifted up. Reaching for the Heavens R e a d : G e n e s i s 1 1 : 1 -- 9 Genesis 11:4 &#39;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&#39; reflection 1Name some of the towers you see others building around you that take glory away from God. What kinds of towers have you built? 2Have you ever taken credit for work when another person really deserved it, or has someone taken credit for work you have done? How did that feel? 3How do you think God feels when we take the credit for his work in our lives?

Their turbulent and complicated relationship shocked their contemporaries and continues to intrigue observers of Russia centuries later. Lovers, companions, and, most likely, husband and wife, Catherine and Potemkin were also close political partners, and for a time Potemkin served as Catherine's de facto co-ruler of the Russian Empire. Their letters offer an intimate glimpse into the lovers' unguarded moments, revealing both ecstatic expressions of love and candid insights on eighteenth-century politics. <br> <br>In February 1774, the Russian empress took Grigory Potemkin for her lover and, it is now believed, secretly married him a few months later. Particularly in the first two years of their relationship, Catherine was consumed by her passion for Potemkin. The hundreds of letters and notes she dashed off to him between assignations in the Winter Palace during this time attest to the giddy exuberance of the new love that so fully embraced her. Love and Conquest contains the most historically significant and personally revealing of these letters, only a few of which have ever before been translated into English. <br> <br>Beginning with Potemkin's letter to Catherine written while off fighting the Turks in 1769 and concluding with his farewell note scribbled the day before his death in 1791, the correspondence spans most of Catherine's reign. The letters are at once personal and political, private and public. Many of Catherine's love letters to Potemkin written during their stormy affair reveal the empress's passionate personality. Potemkin's letters provide rare insight into his arrogant and mercurial character, while serving to dispel the myth of Potemkin as little more than a corrupt sycophant. <br> <br>Love and Conquest reveals the complexity of Catherine and Potemkin's personal relationship in light of dramatic changes in matters of state, foreign relations, and military engagements. After their love cooled, Catherine and Potemkin continued to discuss and debate a wide range of state affairs in their letters, including the annexation of the Crimea, court politics, wars against the Ottoman Empire and Sweden, and the colonization of southern Russia. Together they carried out the most dramatic territorial expansion in the history of imperial Russia, transforming Catherine into a powerful world leader and creating a bond of affection that would never fully fade. Readers will find in the letters new insights on Russia's most famous empress, her passions, and her world.</p></p><p><p>Douglas Smith is author of Working the Rough Stone: Freemasonry and Society in Eighteenth-Century Russia, which won the William W.

It represents the synthesis of twenty years&#x2019; of research on immigration and emigration, two processes that are, by their nature, as inseparables as the two sides of a coin, yet so different in appearance that we are led to believe that one can be understood without reference to the other. By highlighting the intrinsic relationship between these two phenomena, Abdelmalek Sayad &#x2013; an Algerian sociologist and close associate of Pierre Bourdieu &#x2013; succeeds in providing a comprehensive and illuminating account of the nature of immigration and the lives of immigrants in the West.<br> <p>Through a sensitive and profound analysis, the author reveals the reality of the displaced existence of immigrants and the harrowing contradictions that characterize it. Among these contradictions is the deep collective dishonesty through which immigration perpetuates itself, where immigrants are compelled, out of respect for themselves and the group that allowed them to leave their country of origin, to play the suffering of emigration and to encourage more of their compatriots to join them. Separated from their families, towns and homelands, and weighed down by the unshakeable guilt of this absence, immigrants are also &#x2018;absent&#x2019; in their country of arrival, where they quickly become victims of exclusion and are seen simply as member of the workforce.<br> </p> <p>Students in sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, politics and geography, as well as the general reader, will find this an invaluable text.</p><b>Abdelmalek Sayad,</b> 1933-1988, Algerian Sociologist and Director of Research at CNRS (National Centre for Sociological Research)</p><h2>A Book Lover&#39;s Journal</h2><p>An exquisite journal with over 100 entries for books.

Inspired by the reflections of great philosophers and writers (e.g., Plato, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Borges, and Calvino), Ordine reveals how the obsession for material goods and the cult of utility ultimately wither the spirit, jeopardizing not only schools and universities, art, and creativity, but also our most fundamental values human dignity, love, and truth.<br><br>Also included is Abraham Flexner&#x2019;s 1939 essay The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge,&#x201d; which originally prompted Ordine to write this book.

It has a wealth of clinical detail that makes it vivid. I recommend it highly. (Fred Pine)<br><br>Sheldon Bach shows how the language of informed listening may be the only instrument that can make the bizarre not an outcast, but merely another existential member of a complex family called humanity. Dr. Bach's empathic listening is the essence of all language which is not merely interested in the sound of words but in what Robert Frost has called the sound of sense. Dr. Bach has cultivated this sound of sense knowing that it is the royal road to healing and that the language of healing is, after all, one of the great therapeutic aspects of love. This book reaches into the perverse and loving in all of us and makes the human condition a little more human, which is no small achievement. (Eugene J. Mahon)<br><br>In this clinically important work, Bach shows us a new way of listening and responding to difficult, perverse, and borderline patients. Sheldon Bach is a psychoanalyst with the unique ability to derive important truths from the study of severe mental illness and extreme examples of depravity. Bach invokes the insights of poets, novelists, and diarists. This breadth of culture enhances the depth of his humane understanding; the depth of his psychoanalytic experience enhances the breadth of his clinical wisdom. This is an engrossing work indeed.

(The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many</h2><p><p>Individual decision making can often be wrong due to misinformation, impulses, or biases. Collective decision making, on the other hand, can be surprisingly accurate. In <i>Democratic Reason</i>, H�l�ne Landemore demonstrates that the very factors behind the superiority of collective decision making add up to a strong case for democracy. She shows that the processes and procedures of democratic decision making form a cognitive system that ensures that decisions taken by the many are more likely to be right than decisions taken by the few. Democracy as a form of government is therefore valuable not only because it is legitimate and just, but also because it is smart.</p><br><p> Landemore considers how the argument plays out with respect to two main mechanisms of democratic politics: inclusive deliberation and majority rule. In deliberative settings, the truth-tracking properties of deliberation are enhanced more by inclusiveness than by individual competence. Landemore explores this idea in the contexts of representative democracy and the selection of representatives. She also discusses several models for the "wisdom of crowds" channeled by majority rule, examining the trade-offs between inclusiveness and individual competence in voting. When inclusive deliberation and majority rule are combined, they beat less inclusive methods, in which one person or a small group decide. <i>Democratic Reason</i> thus establishes the superiority of democracy as a way of making decisions for the common good.</p></p><p><p>"H�l�ne Landemore's book is a landmark in the study of collective decision making. It scrutinizes and synthesizes a vast body of work, paying as much attention to the failures of deliberation and majority voting as to their achievements. Nobody working on normative theories of democracy can afford to ignore it."<b>--Jon Elster, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Making an important contribution to democratic theory, this outstanding book takes seriously the possibility of popular rule and successful democratic decision making. Paying close attention to positive theory and empirical evidence, it offers a gust of fresh air. It will have a large audience both within and outside the political theory community."<b>--Benjamin Page, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"Fresh voices--who understand cutting-edge social science--are badly needed in political theory and philosophy. With bold and plausible arguments, Landemore's important book is not more of the same old same old, but instead brings a whole different set of models and approaches to bear on democratic theory. A real achievement, Democratic Reason will have a wide readership."<b>--Gerald Gaus, University of Arizona</b></p><b>H�l�ne Landemore</b> is Associate Professor of Political Science at Yale University.

The goal is to provide illustrations of how modem mathematics is actually employed to solve relevant contemporary problems. Although these independent chapters were prepared primarily for teachers in the general mathematical sciences, they should prove valuable to students, teachers, and research scientists in many of the fields of application as well. Prerequisites for each chapter and suggestions for the teacher are provided. Several of these chapters have been tested in a variety of classroom settings, and all have undergone extensive peer review and revision. Illustrations and exercises are included in most chapters. Some units can be covered in one class, whereas others provide sufficient material for a few weeks of class time. Volume 1 contains 23 chapters and deals with differential equations and, in the last four chapters, problems leading to partial differential equations. Applications are taken from medicine, biology, traffic systems and several other fields. The 14 chapters in Volume 2 are devoted mostly to problems arising in political science, but they also address questions appearing in sociology and ecology. Topics covered include voting systems, weighted voting, proportional representation, coalitional values, and committees. The 14 chapters in Volume 3 emphasize discrete mathematical methods such as those which arise in graph theory, combinatorics, and networks.</p><p></p><h2>The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era</h2><p>Micheline Ishay recounts the dramatic struggle for human rights across the ages in a book that brilliantly synthesizes historical and intellectual developments from the Mesopotamian Codes of Hammurabi to today's era of globalization. As she chronicles the clash of social movements, ideas, and armies that have played a part in this struggle, Ishay illustrates how the history of human rights has evolved from one era to the next through texts, cultural traditions, and creative expression. Writing with verve and extraordinary range, she develops a framework for understanding contemporary issues from the debate over globalization to the intervention in Kosovo to the climate for human rights after September 11, 2001. The only comprehensive history of human rights available, the book will be essential reading for anyone concerned with humankind's quest for justice and dignity.<br><br>Ishay structures her chapters around six core questions that have shaped human rights debate and scholarship: What are the origins of human rights? Why did the European vision of human rights triumph over those of other civilizations? Has socialism made a lasting contribution to the legacy of human rights? Are human rights universal or culturally bound? Must human rights be sacrificed to the demands of national security? Is globalization eroding or advancing human rights? As she explores these questions, Ishay also incorporates notable documents&#x2014;writings, speeches, and political statements&#x2014;from activists, writers, and thinkers throughout history.</p><p>"A definitive account of the history of human rights told from the perspective of those struggling to obtain them. Using the Enlightenment, industrialization, war, national self-determination, and globalization as lenses through which to look at their evolution, Ishay brings both historical context and conceptual acuity to modern debates about the role of human rights in a multicultural world.

Cause et Cure, attributed to Hildegard, is both a cosmological text and a medical handbook; it is a densely layered work woven together from diverse threads. It begins with a chapter on cosmology which leads to consideration of the human being as a small-scale copy of the universe. From here the focus shifts to the diseases and disorders which afflict human beings. The sections on treatment which follow provide information on medieval pharmacology and herbal healing. The text discusses the differences between male and female, human sexuality, embryology, sleep and dreams, signs predicting death or survival, astrological influences.The Introduction sketches Hildegard&#39;s life and career, and describes the cultural context with emphasis on medieval medicine. The Interpretive Essay discusses the selections presented in translation and alerts the reader to the benefits as well as the limits of medieval health care.

It explores the animals and plants of the Southern Appalachians and the webs of interdependence that connect them.<br><br>Within the region's roughly 35 million acres, extending from north Georgia through the Carolinas to northern Virginia, exists a mosaic of habitats, each fostering its own unique natural community. Stories of the animals and plants of the Southern Appalachians are intertwined with descriptions of the seasons, giving readers a glimpse into the interlinked rhythms of nature, from daily and yearly cycles to long-term geological changes. Residents and visitors to Great Smoky Mountains or Shenandoah National Parks, the Blue Ridge Parkway, or any of the national forests or other natural attractions within the region will welcome this appealing introduction to its ecological wonders.<br><br></p><p>"The Southern Appalachian mountains are teeming with life--the birds and giant trees are obvious enough, but in the soil, the streams and springs, and even the tops of those tall trees, insects, fungi, salamanders, and mosses abound. The mountains would be impressive even if they, like tropical rain forests, were the same from month to month, but here the forms of life present a seasonal pageant as well. <i>Mountain Nature</i> takes a new perspective on this wonderful diversity, following the seasonal path from spring wildflowers to summer green to fall harvest and winter quiet."--Peter S.

The vivid first-person accounts of more than fifty black residents detail aspects of their lives throughout the twentieth century. Their stories show that the roots of Princeton&#x2019;s African American community are as deeply intertwined with the town and university as they are with the history of the United States, the legacies of slavery, and the nation&#x2019;s current conversations on race.</p><br><p>Drawn from an oral history collaboration with residents of the Witherspoon-Jackson neighborhood, Princeton undergraduates, and their professor, Kathryn Watterson, neighbors speak candidly about Jim Crow segregation, the consequences of school integration, World Wars I and II, and the struggles for equal opportunities and civil rights. Despite three centuries of legal and economic obstacles, African American residents have created a flourishing, ethical, and humane neighborhood in which to raise their children, care for the sick and elderly, worship, stand their ground, and celebrate life. Abundantly filled with photographs, <i>I Hear My People Singing</i> personalizes the injustices faced by generations of black Princetonians&#x2015;including the famed Paul Robeson&#x2015;and highlights the community&#x2019;s remarkable achievements. The introductions to each chapter provide historical context, as does the book&#x2019;s foreword by noted scholar, theologian, and activist Cornel West.</p><br><p>An intimate testament of the black community&#x2019;s resilience and ingenuity, <i>I Hear My People Singing</i> adds a never-before-compiled account of poignant black experience to an American narrative that needs to be heard now more than ever.</p></p><p><p>"An extraordinary and most necessary book, <i>I Hear My People Singing</i> recasts American history as a whole by presenting in their own words the full lives of black Princetonians, lives forged within the utterly everyday Americanness of enslavement, segregation, and insult. This book is so very welcome, now that we are facing up to the realities of white supremacy in even so admirable a place as Princeton. Thank you, Kathryn Watterson, for letting us hear from these Princetonians so long behind the veil."<b>--Nell Irvin Painter, author of <i>The History of White People</i></b></p><p>"Kathryn Watterson has devoted her entire life as a writer to issues of justice. From the American prison system to women's rights and the stories of people of color, few writers in this country have captured the humanity and heroism of the disenfranchised like Watterson. <i>I Hear My People Singing</i> stands alone in its telling of stories untold, stories essential to understanding the unwritten history of America. At this moment in time, this beautiful book is essential reading."<b>--Emily Mann, Artistic Director, McCarter Theatre</b></p><p>"This is a beautifully conceived and executed book, one of real significance. The continuity of challenges that black Princetonians face, including the mixed blessings of desegregation, despite significant assaults of racism, resonates so well with our current struggles throughout the United States."<b>--Wilbert H. Ahern, University of Minnesota, Morris</b></p><p>"<i>I Hear My People Singing</i> adds to the growing collection of studies and memoirs of African Americans around elite white colleges and universities. Because many of these volumes have focused on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, not the twentieth, this book will extend their scope and value. This is all the more the case because the book at once reflects and reflects on the progressive racial integration of Princeton over the past half century."<b>--David Moltke-Hansen, former President, Historical Society of Pennsylvania</b></p><b>Kathryn Watterson</b> is a writer whose award-winning books include <i>Women in Prison</i> (Doubleday) and <i>Not by the Sword</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster).

Yet, while many of us find these birds interesting, they can be a difficult group to identify. Many hawks zip past us too quickly, and the nocturnal habits of most owls leave us in the dark about their appearance. This book will help you identify these fascinating birds as well as learn a bit about their natural history. </p><p> When trying to identify birds it is important to remember the following motto: I don't know. </p><p> Really, it's okay to say it. Too many birders will get an inconclusive view of a bird and then just guess. With practice, you can identify birds from incredibly short glimpses of them, but there will always be some "I don't knows." And even if you do get a good look and still can't identify the bird, you will have learned from the process. The next time you see that species, it will be familiar to you and you may see another field mark or behavior to help in its identification. And don't forget to watch the birds as well! Keeping a checklist is fun and a way to record your sightings, but careful observations will help you understand these interesting creatures. Watching birds in their environment reveals interactions that link all of nature together. </p></p><h2>The Gardener&#39;s Guide to Growing Clematis</h2><p>Raymond Evison, world authority on clematis, here provides a fresh look at the genus by focusing on not just the popular large-flowered cultivars but also on the less well known species.

Why, asks Dr. Porkert, shouldn't medical men everywhere have access to the premises and results of this medical knowledge?<br> <br> In this book he presents a coherent and systematic account of Chinese theories&#x2014;the system of correspondence that underlies all of Chinese medicine&#x2014;using a new and precise Latin terminology (with English equivalents provided for most terms) that he devised over the past decade. The book is based directly and exclusively on Chinese sources, including recent Chinese secondary literature.<br> <br> Chapter 1 introduces the concepts that are the foundation of the system of correspondences&#x2014;the polar combination yin-yang, which provides a basis for the analysis of all phenomena into complementary groups, and <i>wu-hsing,</i> which Dr. Porkert calls the "Five Evolutive Phases," and which are used to resolve cyclic processes into five temporally and qualitatively distinct parts. In Chapter 2 he takes up concepts which relate the body to the cosmos under the title "Phase Energetics" <i>(y�n-ch'i);</i> these define meteorological, climatic, and immunological factors in health and disease. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on systems of concepts concerned with the body itself. The author has named these systems orbisiconography, sinarteriology, and foraminology. Orbisiconography <i>(tsang-hsiang),</i> the "imagery of functional orbs," describes the relationships of the functional systems within the body. It is not, as Dr. Porkert points out, analogous to but the opposite of Western comparative anatomy. Sinarteriology, the study of energetic conduits <i>(ching-luo),</i> and foraminology, the study of sensitive points <i>(shu-hs�eh),</i> indicate the functional relationships manifested at the body's surface as well as within it. The book's systematic description of these disciplines involved in acupuncture is a powerful antidote to basic misconceptions prevalent in earlier Western writing on the subject.<br> <br> This is Volume III in the MIT East Asian Science series, edited by Nathan Sivin.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)"A classic presentation of the internal consistency of Chinese medicine. It is a book one can by in anticipation of rereading and studying it for many years."<br> &#x2014;<i>East-West Journal</i><br><br>"This work is especially noteworthy for its detailed discussions of the general theoretical foundations of Chinese cosmology and such philosophical and religious principles as <i>yin-yang,</i> the "five elements" (<i>wu-hsing,</i> or what Porkert translates as the "five evolutive phases") and <i>ch'i</i> (matter-energy)... [It] is important for its emphasis on the dynamic-functional nature of the medical system or what Joseph Needham has called the organismic time-centeredness of Chinese ideology. In short, this is an impressive piece of philosophical, medical, and philological scholarship and represents the first serious attempt to decipher some of the meaning and significance of traditional Chinese medicine."<br> &#x2014;<i>Religious Studies Review</i></p><h2>A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture</h2><p>The <i>Companion</i> combines a broad grounding in the essential texts and contexts of the modernist movement with the unique insights of scholars whose careers have been devoted to the study of modernism. <ul> <li>An essential resource for students and teachers of modernist literature and culture</li> <li>Broad in scope and comprehensive in coverage</li> <li>Includes more than 60 contributions from some of the most distinguished modernist scholars on both sides of the Atlantic</li> <li>Brings together entries on elements of modernist culture, contemporary intellectual and aesthetic movements, and all the genres of modernist writing and art</li> <li>Features 25 essays on the signal texts of modernist literature, from James Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Ulysses</i> to Zora Neal Hurston&#x2019;s <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i></li> <li>Pays close attention to both British and American modernism</li> </ul></p><p><i>A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture</i> is an essential resource for students and teachers of modernism.

Beautifully illustrated and written in a clear and concise style, it also includes brief biographies of leading architects, from Brunelleschi and Imhotep to Le Corbusier and Richard Rogers. The text is complimented by over 250 beautiful and meticulous line drawings, labeled cross-sections and diagrams. These include precise drawings of typical building features, making it easy for readers to identify particular period styles.<br> The first edition of the <em>Dictionary of Architecture</em> received excellent reviews. Now it has been fully revised and expanded, bringing it completely up-to-date. New entries include definitions of landscape terms and biographies of modern architects. Each entry is followed by a mini-bibliography, with suggestions for further reading. It also contains over 50 new illustrations.<br> This is an essential work of reference for anyone with an interest in architecture.

His many stimulating studies include <em>The English Heritage Book of Victorian Churches, Egyptomania: The Egyptian Revival as a Recurring Theme in the History of Taste</em>, and <em>A Celebration of Death</em>.<br>It is not clear whether this second edition contains more than 6,000 (dust jacket) or merely more than 5,000 (Oxford University Press Web site) entries; the book itself provides no help beyond the unappealing prospect of counting them. In any case, the number is substantial and seems more than sufficient, according to the author, to help architecture "become more accessible to the general public" and to provide a source of "helpful information" for students and professionals. More than 250 of author Curl's own detailed and stylish line drawings complement the text. With a small percentage of relevant exceptions, coverage has been limited to "Europe, the British Isles, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, and Latin America." To cite some exceptions, there are entries on contemporary Japanese architects whose contributions have been felt beyond Japan and on terms of non-Western origin (<i>mandala, stupa</i>) that are commonly included in general dictionaries of the English language.<p>The preponderance of entries is architectural terms, many with multiple definitions and some (including <i>arcade, arch, capital,</i> and <i>rustication</i>) differentiating the many types of each in both word and diagram. The entry on <i>chimney</i> is followed by 25 short entries of hyphenated words, beginning with <i>chimney-arch</i> and ending with <i>chimney-wing.</i> The many hundreds of biographical entries tend to be longer and livelier, often giving Curl a chance to show off his enthusiasms but also crammed with solid information on their subjects' importance and major works. Cross-referencing, especially within entries, is extensive. Many entries conclude with references keyed to a large list of abbreviations or works cited in the preface, which includes a three-page bibliographical essay on key architectural reference works.</p><p>The first edition, published in 1999 as <i>The Dictionary of Architecture,</i> included a 70-page bibliography that was unfortunately omitted in the second edition. The new edition has, however, increased the number of entries and line drawings by an aggregate of some 118 pages. Though it lacks the useful national surveys found in the standard <i>Penguin Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture</i> (5th ed., 1998), the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture</i> is more current for contemporary architects and trends and is highly recommended for academic and public libraries. <i>Craig Bunch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Why&nbsp;has the technology -- or the idea -- so popular during the 1990s pre-internet area become so visible once again through consumer applications such as Oculus? What does it mean -- what does it do -- to us? Digital Sensations looks closely at the ways representational forms generated by communication technologies -- especially digital/optical virtual technologies -- affect the "lived" world.Virtual reality, or VR, is a technological reproduction of the process of perceiving the real; yet that process is "filtered" through the social realities and embedded cultural assumptions about human bodies, perception, and space held by the technology's creators.<br>Through critical histories of the technology -- of vision, light, space, and embodiment -- Ken Hillis traces the various and often contradictory intellectual and metaphysical impulses behind the Western transcendental wish to achieve an ever more perfect copy of the real. Because virtual technologies are new, these histories also address the often unintended and underconsidered consequences -- such as alienating new forms of surveillance and commodification -- flowing from their rapid dissemination. Current and proposed virtual technologies reflect a Western desire to escape the body Hillis says.<br>Exploring topics from VR and other, earlier visual technologies, Hillis's penetrating perspective on the cultural power of place and space broadens our view of the interplay between social relations and technology.</p><p>Ken Hillis is Professor of Media and Technology Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

Lauder Collection</h2><p>In the decades around 1900, postcards were Twitter, email, Flickr and Facebook, all wrapped into one. A postcard craze swept the world, and billions of cards were bought, mailed and pasted into albums. Many famous artists turned to the new medium, but one of the great pleasures and enigmas of postcards is how some of the most beautiful and interesting examples were made by artists whose names we barely know. Drawing on the riches of the Leonard A. Lauder Postcard Collection (probably the finest and most comprehensive collection of its type), this gorgeous book traces the historical and cultural themes--enthralling, exciting, and sometimes disturbing--of the modern age. The first general publication on the postcard as an artistic medium since the mid-1970s, <i>The Postcard Age</i> is organized thematically, with chapters devoted to urban life, the changing role of women, sports, celebrity, new technologies, the stylish collectors&#x2019; cards of Art Nouveau and World War I. The result is at once a vivid picture of the concerns and pastimes of the turn of the century and a sampler from the Lauder&#x2019;s vast archives.</p><p>Leonard A. Lauder, the billionaire son of Est�e, has spent a lifetime scouring kiosks by the Seine and souvenir shops off Portobello Road for rare vintage postcards. He began his quest as a boy, in the 1930s. buying postcards of famous New York City buildings at Woolworth's with his allowance of 5 cents. Lauder is now 79, and his peerless collection is finally getting its day in the sun with "The Postcard Age" ($45), a book and corresponding show (through April 14) at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. (<i>T: The New York Times Style Magazine</i>)<br><br>"The Postcard Age," opening Wednesday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, features 700 examples from the era, drawn from the collection of Leonard Lauder, chairman emeritus of Est�e Lauder Cos. (His collection numbers more than 160,000 in all.) The cards offer a window into the past, writes Mr. Lauder in the book that accompanies the show. But even beyond that, "postcards help remind us that history is lived and experienced by individuals." (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</p><h2>American Qur&#39;an</h2><p><p><strong>A Holiday Gift Guide Selection in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong></p><p><strong>This triumph of American art, reflecting a decade of travel in the Islamic work, unites two cultures with its transcendent power.</strong></p><p>At a time when the United States was involved in two wars against Islamic nations, American-born artist Sandow Birk wanted to understand the Qur'an as it is, and always has been intended: a universal message to humankind. But to do so, he first needed to comprehend what Islam's holiest book meant to an American living in the twenty-first century. Indeed, how has the Qur'an related to us, as Americans, in this life, in this time?</p><p>In an attempt to answer his own question, Birk embarked on the most ambitious work of his career. Following in the grand traditions of ancient Arabic and Islamic artists, he began hand-transcribing the entire Qur'an as was done in centuries past&#x2015;abiding by the traditional prescriptions as to the colors of ink, the formatting of the pages, the size of margins and illuminations of page headings and medallions marking verses and passages. He then took each sura and set it against a backdrop from everyday American life, one that reflected his renowned "skate-surf" ascetic.</p><p>Even before the first images of what became known as the <em>American Qur'an</em> began appearing in public, in 2009, veteran art critics were concerned about its reception. While Birk wasn't illustrating the Qur'an itself, the pairing of Islam&#x2019;s holiest text with scenes from contemporary American life seemed adventuresome, given the climate of the times. The project, however, was not only welcomed by the Muslim community but also celebrated as an "ambitious and valuable undertaking" (<em>New York Times</em>). At the same time, many saw it as taking part in an ancient tradition, one that, according to Yale University professor Zareena Grewal, "eschewed the irony and satire that have become the knee-jerk impulse of so many Western artists."</p><p>Now appearing in full for the first time ever, this lavishly designed volume&#x2015;containing all 114 suras&#x2015;melds the past with the present, East with the West like nothing before it. The result, hailed by Reza Aslan as "a great favor, not only to Muslims, but also to Americans," is one of the most original art books to appear in decades.</p> 427 color illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Sandow Birk</strong>&#x2019;s work deals with contemporary life.

The reader who doesn&#x2019;t open <em>American Qur&#x2019;an</em>&nbsp;out of devotion will be drawn to its images. Birk has created pictures to accompany classic texts for years, and these painted scenes seem like real America, circa 2015&#x2015;more America than <em>Quran</em>...This is a book whose impact will be felt more in the debate that it generates than in the readers who spend the time that it demands.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David D&#x2019;Arcy, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;From the opening page, Birk's art stuns...in a distinctive and visually impressive style that begs for close attention. Meanwhile, the juxtaposition of words and images prompts the reader to engage deeply with the text.... This masterpiece is important as an accessible and enjoyable introduction to the Qur'an for non-Muslim Americans, but even for Muslims and others familiar with the Qur'an, it bears weighty messages, inviting a reconsideration of sacred texts in the context of ordinary American lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly, Starred review</em></strong></p><h2>The Letters of Lewis Carroll: 2 vols.</h2><p>Bound in blue cloth with the spine stamped in gilt.</p><p></p><h2>Americans in Paris 1860-1900</h2><p>As the center of the art world in the late nineteenth century, Paris was a magnet for American art students and artists. They flocked to the studios of French artists like Jean-L�on G�r�me, William Bouguereau, and others, dreamed of showing their work at the annual Paris Salon, and watched intently as new styles such as Impressionism began to take hold. Hardly an American painter was unaffected by developments in Paris, and even those who chose not to study there wanted their work to be affirmed by French audiences and taste makers.<br>This beautifully illustrated book traces the role of American artists in Paris from the Salon des Refus�s, in 1863, to the emergence of a uniquely American style of painting at the turn of the century. It includes iconic images by John Singer Sargent, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, and Winslow Homer, and by many other artists whose names and work were more widely known then than now.<br>Engaging essays written by notable scholars explore why artists were drawn to Paris, how they responded to what they found there, and what they retained of their experience. In addition, the significance of the <i>Expositions Universelles</i>, the French view of American artists in Paris, and the role these artists played in shaping the great American collections of modern French painting are discussed. Featuring more than 100 paintings, the essays are followed by artists&#x2019; biographies, an illustrated, annotated list of works, and a complete bibliography.</p><p><b>Kathleen Adler</b> is Director of Education at the National Gallery, London. <b>Erica E.

Focusing on the decades from the 1930s through the 1960s, David Hollinger discusses the scientists, social scientists, philosophers, and historians who fought the Christian biases that had kept Jews from fully participating in American intellectual life. Today social critics take for granted the comparatively open outlook developed by these men (and men they were, mostly), and charge that their cosmopolitanism was not sufficiently multicultural. Yet Hollinger shows that the liberal cosmopolitans of the mid-century generation defined themselves against the realities of their own time: McCarthyism, Nazi and Communist doctrines, a legacy of anti-Semitic quotas, and both Protestant and Catholic versions of the notion of a "Christian America." The victory of liberal cosmopolitans was so sweeping by the 1960s that it has become easy to forget the strength of the enemies they fought.</p><p>Most books addressing the emergence of Jewish intellectuals celebrate an illustrious cohort of literary figures based in New York City. But the pieces collected here explore the long-postponed acceptance of Jewish immigrants in a variety of settings, especially the social science and humanities faculties of major universities scattered across the country. Hollinger acknowledges the limited, rather parochial sense of "mankind" that informed some mid-century thinking, but he also inspires in the reader an appreciation for the integrationist aspirations of a society truly striving toward equality. His cast of characters includes Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, Richard Hofstadter, Robert K. Merton, Lionel Trilling, and J. Robert Oppenheimer.</p></p><p><p>"David Hollinger is arguably the leading American intellectual historian working today and perhaps the best historical essayist of his generation.

A guide to the principles of collection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert action and to their interrelationship with policymakers and democratic values, Silent Warfare provides a useful framework for understanding today's altered intelligence world as well as the future. It is an informative book for anyone intrigued by the shadowy world of the spy or concerned with security threats, terrorism, or economic espionage.</p></p><p>Abram N. Shulsky was a senior fellow at the National Strategy Information Center in Washington when he wrote Silent Warfare. He currently serves in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Gary J. Schmitt was also a senior fellow at the National Strategy Information Center while preparing the second edition of this book. He has served as executive director of the President&#39;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and as minority staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.Intended as a textbook to contribute to the academic study of this specialized field, this work also aims to counter some of the more alarmist and anti-intelligence books available. In eight chapters it explains the concepts, philosophies, and procedures of intelligence-gathering analysis and management. It examines how intelligence was used in various historical situations to explain a government's actions. It shows the importance of an individual's personality at every step of the process, particularly when it comes to acting on available intelligence. This easy-to-read-and-understand book should be considered by academic and large public libraries and those collections that support courses in security studies.<br><i>- Daniel K.

It shows him applying his classical economic theory to policy questions of lasting concern: the desirability of sustained growth of national wealth and population, the merits of capitalism versus socialism, and the suitable scope of government intervention in the competitive market economy. His answers to those questions have profound relevance today, and they serve to illustrate the enduring power and imagination of his distinctive liberal utilitarian philosophy. The lucid introduction and explanatory notes clarify Mill's philosophy in relation to his economic theory, and make full use of the most recent scholarship.</p><p><br>Jonathan Riley is Associate Professor, Murphy Institute, Tulane University.

Mill's Philosophy</em> (OUP, 1988).<br></p><h2>Ren� Magritte: Newly Discovered Works: Catalogue Raisonn� Volume VI: Oil Paintings, Gouaches, Drawings</h2><p><p>Ren� Magritte (1898&#x2013;1967) was a surrealist artist whose thought-provoking works used ordinary objects to challenge how viewers perceived reality. His extensive oeuvre was documented in a comprehensive five-volume project, led by distinguished art critic and writer David Sylvester. In the years that followed the publication of the final volume in 1997, numerous works purporting to be by Magritte appeared on the art market. Under the auspices of the Fondation Magritte, a committee was established to verify the authenticity of newly discovered works as well as those previously recorded as "whereabouts unknown" or listed as appendix items in the original volumes of the<i> Ren� Magritte Catalogue Raisonn�</i>.</p><p><i>Ren� Magritte: Newly Discovered Works</i> includes color illustrations of 130 previously unpublished or unknown works authenticated by the committee between September 2000 and March 2010. Like its predecessors, this volume is the culmination of years of research, which synthesizes new discoveries about the artworks and details of the life of Magritte himself. Accompanying text and comparative documentation provide a wealth of complementary information, including the circumstances of a work's discovery, references to letters, quotations in their original languages, and citations from previous volumes.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Whitfield</b> is an independent art historian, writer, and curator.Representing works authenticated by the Comit� Magritte from 2000-2010, this collection comprises oils, gouaches, and drawings that provide a more complete picture of the Surrealist's prodigious output. While there is minimal critical discussion, the works are paired with the history of their ownership, as well as speculation about their origins. Previously unattributed oil paintings such as "La r�colte des nuages, dominated by a luminous, twilit sky, rendered in blues and greens, and "L'Embellie," which depicts a door, standing alone, opening out into a seascape, complement Magritte's more canonical work. The master's sly, dark humor is certainly evident in "Par une belle fin d'apres-midi," a 1964 gouache, wherein two coffins sit in lively, lighthearted discussion. Included also is a wider array of less polished works: sketches and drawings that are documents of the creative mind at work or illustrations for various publications or gifts to friends. In his letters, Magritte would often include ballpoint renderings of completed works, as in "Letter with sketch of ��La dur�e poignard�,'" in which a train-car emerges from a fireplace above an alternately quotidian and poignant note of 1938 to Marcel Mari�n. Returning to the motif that made him iconic, Magritte seems to playfully complicate issues of representation in the self-referential "Les deux myst�res," (after the painting of the same name) showing a massive pipe levitating above a framed image of "La trahison des images," which declared, famously, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe".

The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.Charles Dickens was born in Landport in Portsmouth on 7 February 1812. Sent to work in a blacking factory at the age of twelve, after his Navy Pay Office clerk father was imprisoned for debt, Dickens&#39;s memories of this unhappy period haunted him throughout his life and influenced much of his writing. After stints as a clerk and a shorthand reporter in the law courts, Dickens became a reporter of parliamentary debates for the Morning Chronicle until the huge success of his first books enabled him to become a full-time author. Charles Dickens died on 9 June 1870, leaving his last novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood unfinished. Peter Ackroyd&#39;s biography of Charles Dickens was published in 1990 to enormous critical acclaim. He has also written another major biography, T.S. Eliot, which was awarded the 1984 Whitbread Prize and was joint winner of the Royal Society of Literature&#39;s William Heinemann Award. Peter Ackroyd&#39;s novels include The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde, Milton in America, Chatterton, The Clerkenwell Tales and The Fall of Troy and his non-fiction works include Ezra Pound and his World, Chaucer and London: The Biography, among others.

It is based on numerous courses given by the author to students and researchers in the health sciences and is written with such readers in mind. Throughout, there is an emphasis on presenting each new topic motivated with real examples of a survival analysis investigation, and then presenting thorough analyses of real data sets. Each chapter concludes with practice exercises to help readers reinforce their understanding of the concepts covered in the chapter. Readers can then extend their knowledge with a more thoroughgoing test. Answers to both are included. Beginning with the basic concepts of survival analysis-time to an event as a variable, censored data, and the hazard function-the author then introduces the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the log-rank test, the Peto test, and the most widely used technique in survival analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model. Later chapters cover techniques for evaluating the proportional hazards assumptions, the stratified Cox procedure, and extending the Cox model to time-dependent variables. Readers will enjoy David Kleinbaum&#39;s style of presentation with numerous figures and diagrams illustrating each idea. As a result, this text makes an excellent introduction for all those coming to the subject for the first time.</p><p><p>This greatly expanded second edition of Survival Analysis- A Self-learning Text provides a highly readable description of state-of-the-art methods of analysis of survival/event-history data.

Relational psychoanalysis diverges in key ways from the assumptions and practices that have traditionally characterized psychoanalysis. At the same time, it preserves, and even extends, the profound understanding of human experience and psychological conflict that has always been the strength of the psychoanalytic approach. Through probing theoretical analysis and illuminating examples, the book offers new and powerful ways to revitalize clinical practice.<p> See also Wachtel's <i>Therapeutic Communication, Second Edition: Knowing What to Say When, </i>an integrative, practical guide for therapists of all orientations.</p></p><p><p> Paul L. Wachtel, PhD, is CUNY Distinguished Professor in the doctoral program in clinical psychology at City College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Yale University and is a graduate of the postdoctoral program in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at New York University, where he is also a faculty member. Dr. Wachtel has lectured and given workshops throughout the world on psychotherapy, personality theory, and the applications of psychological theory and research to the major social issues of our time. He has been a leading voice for integrative thinking in the human sciences and was a cofounder of the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration. Dr. Wachtel is a recipient of the Hans H.

Contemporary theorists and clinicians are rethinking fundamental assumptions of psychoanalytic practice and searching for more effective ways to understand patients and help them overcome problems. This conceptually rich volume reexamines the nature of the psychotherapeutic relationship, the place of systemic thinking in psychoanalytic theory, and the role of insight, experience, and acceptance in psychotherapy. It will be valuable to psychodynamic therapists working towards more effective approaches to intervention, and to cognitive-behavioral therapists who wish to explore the richness of the psychotherapeutic relationship and of inner experience. It would be an excellent text for a graduate seminar exploring contemporary approaches to psychoanalysis or integrative approaches to psychotherapy."--James Pretzer, PhD, Director, Cleveland Center for Cognitive Therapy</p><p>"Wachtel has written yet another classic! This is a book of utmost importance to the field of psychotherapy, one that will benefit both the beginning student and the most seasoned practitioner. Wachtel elucidates the radical clinical implications of the relational turn in psychoanalysis. He shows how this emerging contextualist paradigm lends itself to meaningful integration with a range of modern psychotherapies. Wachtel is not only an important clinical contributor; he is also a master teacher. You will want to read and reread this book."--Lewis Aron, PhD, Director, Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, New York University</p><p>"Wachtel's magnificent book is a truly remarkable combination of rigorous, comprehensive scholarship and practical clinical wisdom. He brings together the whole range of relational thinking in psychoanalysis in presenting a fully contextual understanding of human emotional experience and its therapeutic transformation. In so doing, he spells out in rich clinical detail the implications of a relational perspective and sensibility for the actual practice of psychotherapy. I highly recommend this clinician-friendly book to students, trainees, and seasoned practitioners of psychotherapy."--Robert D. Stolorow, PhD, founding faculty member, Institute of Contemporary Psychoanalysis, Los Angeles</p><p>"We have needed a book like this. Wachtel has artfully charted the sea change from classical to intersubjective formulations and has made clear what the relational turn means for clinicians. His writing is direct and unaffected, and yet so nuanced that both novice therapists and seasoned colleagues will benefit from his perspective. In a voice that is unfailingly respectful and integrative, Wachtel explores core elements of the contemporary relational movement, ties those themes to relevant clinical challenges, and in the process provides a condensed but remarkably comprehensive course in the history of psychoanalytic ideas. This book will become a classic; it belongs in the libraries of therapists of all orientations."--Nancy McWilliams, PhD, ABPP, Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</p><p>"A very significant undertaking. I am completely delighted that this book has been written, and even more pleased that it was Paul Wachtel who did it. Who else could have brought the ideas and clinical practice of Relational psychoanalysis to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapists? No one. Wachtel has hit the ball out of the park. He shows Relational psychoanalysis to be the examination and creation of meaning in its interpersonal context, and illustrates how old meanings, themselves created in the contexts of their times, are recontextualized in the here and now. I have been frustrated for decades that most people--including psychotherapists--do not know how much psychoanalysis has changed since the era still being portrayed in <i>New Yorker</i> cartoons. This book is a major contribution, and it may just be the beginning of a new conversation."--Donnel B. Stern, PhD, coeditor, <i>Contemporary Psychoanalysis</i></p><p>"Every family therapist should read this book! Wachtel offers a depth of insight and comprehensiveness of vision that will open new worlds to the systemically trained reader. His relational version of psychoanalytic thought shares family therapy's commitment to understanding people in the context of the key relationships in their lives, enabling the insights of depth psychology and systems thinking to be integrated in new and important ways. This remarkable book will be an instant classic."--Marcia Sheinberg, LCSW, Director of Training and Clinical Services, Ackerman Institute for the Family</p><br><br>"Presents helpful examples of the ways in which all of us in our everyday work find ourselves unintentionally criticizing patients and undermining their self-esteem....Wachtel highlights the therapist's supportive approach in providing the necessary conditions of comfort or safety to approach and integrate the aspects of the self that have been split off and repudiated. A particular strength is Wachtel's focus on the language of psychotherapy....This book encourages me about the future of psychoanalysis. It suggests that the eclectic curiosity, and open-mindedness Wachtel exemplifies can lead us to a more patient-centered, humane, and integrative psychoanalysis." , <i>Metapsychology Online Reviews</i> Published On: 2010-10-21<br><br>"This book is an excellent way for psychotherapists unfamiliar with how psychoanalysis has changed since Freud to familiarize themselves with recent developments from a writer who does not get lost in the jargon that distances many who find psychoanalytic language lacking in clarity. Psychoanalysts will find some critiques of traditional views and expansions of ways of looking at the clinical situation....Wachtel provides a clear and direct understanding with plenty of clinical examples of how his view of cyclical psychodynamics is informed by relational psychoanalysis. This book is an important contribution to the practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, rewarding and accessible to anyone involved in this enterprise.", <i>Psychoanalytic Psychology</i> Published On: 2010-10-21<br><br>"Paul Wachtel shows how relational theory has redirected psychoanalytic inquiry toward a more powerful understanding of the actual experiences with other people that underlie personality development. He demonstrates how even the most deeply unconscious processes must be viewed in the context of daily interactions and broader social and cultural dynamics....The book will greatly advance the work not only of therapists who work in a psychodynamic vein, but also of those who have previously found psychoanalytic approaches uncongenial.

It affirms much that we actually do, it teaches much wisdom, and sparks with therapeutic enthusiasm.", <i>Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry</i> Published On: 2010-10-21<br><br>"This is a most helpful book for clinicians in several respects. First, it is written in an engaging style that holds the reader's attention even as Wachtel addresses complex theoretical distinctions and their practice implications. Second, Wachtel clearly articulates the basic tenets of relational psychoanalytic theory and its differences from earlier psychoanalytic theories. Third, he describes the technical implications of these differences with practical suggestions and superb clinical illustrations. Finally, he adds his particular integrative psychodynamic perspective to the body of literature on relational theory and practice. All of this makes it an important book for clinicians at all levels of sophistication....Wachtel demonstrates that an integrative approach that is grounded in a thorough understanding of the theories and practice models involved can enhance practice. He argues persuasively that integrative practice has its risks, but so does orthodoxy. He challenges us as clinicians to move beyond our comfort zones.", <i>Clinical Social Work Journal</i> Published On: 2010-10-21<br><br>"Dr. Wachtel's scholarly approach brings a progressive and integrative tone to the study of psychotherapy....This is an excellent book about the changes in perspectives in psychoanalysis and is very persuasive about the merits of the relational model.

In this very scholarly, astute, and accessible book, Watchtel covers the most important tenets of relational psychotherapy....Wachtel's clinical examples are very rich and particularly congruent with social work values. Throughout he emphasizes collaboration with the client by developing new narratives, building on client strengths, and depathologizing....The book is especially creative in its integration of neuroscience, forms of memory (procedural and explicit), infant research, attachment theory, internal working models, family and systems therapy, cognitive and behavioral therapy, and trauma theory. Interwoven throughout are contemporary contributions to relational theory and practice so that these models provide the reader with exposure to multiplicity of contemporary theories.

Kroll</b>, Ph.D. (1976), University of Michigan, is Professor of Chinese at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has published widely on medieval Chinese literature and cultural history.'This volume is a signal contribution to the field that reflects a truly herculean effort on the part of Professor Kroll and his colleagues. Each entry elucidates finely grained distinctions in meaning, with an especially impressive attention to nuances in the English language that is crucial to making these differences clear. For students of classical and medieval Chinese this dictionary will be indispensable, but even seasoned scholars will find its comprehensive and precise analyses of tremendous value.' Pauline Yu, "President of the American Council of Learned Societies" This dictionary is both helpful and unusual: besides the more common meanings for each entry, it provides the reader with a rich panoply of expressions from the realms of religion (Buddhism, Daoism), medicine and materia medica, as well as cosmology and many other fields. Extremely useful for every student of traditional China, indispensable for the study of early and medieval China.' Michael Lackner, "Professor of Sinology, University of Erlangen, Germany" This reference work was worth the wait. It will be consulted by seasoned China scholars as well as beginning learners. The definitions of over 8000 primary characters are exact, elegantly concise, and yet complete. [ ] This dictionary will revolutionize Chinese language learning. A massive achievement, it will be a tool that no serious student of Chinese language (Classical, Medieval, or even Modern) should do without. Ronald Egan, "Stanford University""<br><br>'This is the new standard in a Chinese-English dictionary of classical Chinese, far better than than the older dictionaries that students have too long used. It is a student s dictionary that scholars and teachers will find necessary as well. Professor Kroll s long experience, combined with meticulous research and an exceptional precision in the English lexicon, offers a range of definitions, both primary and extended, that give the user a sense of what the word means and how it can be used. The inclusion of the Middle Chinese pronunciation is an immense convenience, immediately showing the student which characters are merely graphic variations for extended usages in a particular frame of reference. His precision in terms of material culture and the natural world is no less welcome.' Stephen Owen, <i>Harvard University</i> 'This volume is a signal contribution to the field that reflects a truly herculean effort on the part of Professor Kroll and his colleagues. Each entry elucidates finely grained distinctions in meaning, with an especially impressive attention to nuances in the English language that is crucial to making these differences clear. For students of classical and medieval Chinese this dictionary will be indispensable, but even seasoned scholars will find its comprehensive and precise analyses of tremendous value.' Pauline Yu, <i>President of the American Council of Learned Societies</i> This dictionary is both helpful and unusual: besides the more common meanings for each entry, it provides the reader with a rich panoply of expressions from the realms of religion (Buddhism, Daoism), medicine and materia medica, as well as cosmology and many other fields. Extremely useful for every student of traditional China, indispensable for the study of early and medieval China.' Michael Lackner, <i>Professor of Sinology, University of Erlangen, Germany</i> This reference work was worth the wait. It will be consulted by seasoned China scholars as well as beginning learners. The definitions of over 8000 primary characters are exact, elegantly concise, and yet complete. [ ] This dictionary will revolutionize Chinese language learning. A massive achievement, it will be a tool that no serious student of Chinese language (Classical, Medieval, or even Modern) should do without.

The Bush Administration, concerned about the legality of harsh interrogation techniques, understood the need to establish a legally viable argument to justify such procedures.

They became known far and wide as "madmen" (smyon pa, pronounced ny�npa), achieving a degree of saintliness in the process. This book offers the first comprehensive study of Tibet's "holy madmen" drawing on their biographies and writings, as well as tantric commentaries, later histories, oral traditions, and more.<br><br>Much of <em>The Holy Madmen of Tibet</em> is dedicated to examining the lives and legacies of the three most famous "holy madmen" who were all of the Kagy� sect: the Madman of Tsang (author of <em>The Life of Milarepa</em>), the Madman of �, and Drukpa K�nl�, Madman of the Drukpa Kagy�. Each born in the 1450s, they rose to prominence during a period of civil war and of great shifts in Tibet's religious culture. <br><br>By focusing on literature written by and about the "holy madmen" and on the yogins' relationships with their public, this book offers in-depth looks at the narrative and social processes out of which sainthood arises, and at the role biographical literature can play in the formation of sectarian identities. By showing how understandings of the "madmen" have changed over time, this study allows for new insights into current notions of "crazy wisdom." In the end, the "holy madmen" are seen as self-aware and purposeful individuals who were anything but insane.<br></p><p><br><strong>David M. DiValerio </strong>is Assistant Professor of History and Religious Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.<br><br>"DiValerio's analysis of the social and narrative processes that create mad sainthood provides a nuanced account of this fascinating tradition, making a significant contribution to the study of Tibetan religion."--Patrick J. Dowd, <em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Holy Madmen of Tibet</em> is a welcome contribution to the study of Tibetan religions and Tantric Buddhism....And although DiValerio has only hinted at some of the possible connections of his work with the broad issue of antinomian religion, I recommend <em>The Holy Madmen of Tibet</em> without hesitation to those who may wish to ponder this question from a comparative angle as well."--Matthew T. Kapstein, <em>Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Holy Madmen of Tibet</em> is among the pioneering studies about the tantric practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism.

The complexity and uniqueness of the Southeast culture area is detailed in The Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 14, Southeast. Its 64 chapters, written by 63 leading authorities, both anthropologists and historians, describe and illustrate the culture of each major tribe and tribal group, their history, transformation, and evolution over time. Regional and sub-regional overviews frame these and summarize the long prehistory of the area. Special topic chapters examine broad aspects of culture that characterize the Southeast and cross tribal lines.

Duyan James, a Liberian native with a braidery in Washington, DC, presents a colorful, fascinating, and gorgeously photographed guide to the art.

His extraordinary novel <em>Springtime in a Broken Mirror</em> revolves around Santiago, a political prisoner in Uruguay, who was jailed after a brutal military coup that saw many of his comrades flee elsewhere. Santiago, feeling trapped, can do nothing but write letters to his family and try to stay sane.</p> <p>Far away, his nine-year-old daughter Beatrice wonders at the marvels of 1970s Buenos Aires, but her grandpa and mother&#x2014;Santiago&#x2019;s beautiful, careworn wife, Graciela&#x2014;struggle to adjust to a life in exile.</p> <p>Published now for the first time in English, <em>Springtime in a Broken Mirror</em> tells with tenderness and fury of the indelible imprint politics leaves on individual lives. Generous and unflinching, it asks whether the broken bonds of family and history can ever truly be mended. Written by one of the masters of the Latin American novel, this is the story of a fractured continent, chronicled through the lives of a single family.</p></p><p><b>Mario Benedetti</b> (1920&#x2013;2009) was a Uruguayan journalist, novelist, and poet. He is considered one of the most important twentieth-century Latin American writers. He won the Queen Sofia Ibero-American Poetry Award in 1999, and the Jos� Mart� prize in 2001. He was the author of many works of poetry, essays, drama, and fiction.<strong>Praise for <em>Springtime in a Broken Mirror</em>:</strong> &#x201c;Benedetti has crafted a portrait of the &#x2018;long parenthesis&#x2019; opened up in Uruguay&#x2019;s society, from which &#x2018;nobody will be able to pick up the thread of the original sentence.&#x2019;&#x201d; <strong>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A wise, lonely novel [and an] &#x201c;honest reflection of exile.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong><em>The New Yorker<br><br></em></strong>A &#x201c;rich, heartbreaking novel. . . . Benedetti&#x2019;s tender yet unflinching portrait of a family in the crushing straits of history is a welcome addition to the small (and hopefully growing) catalogue of his work that has been translated into English.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)</strong> &nbsp; &#x201c;This powerful novel evokes the works of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong> &nbsp; &#x201c;Mario Benedetti was full of joy . . . he wrote it all, and his genius, his talent, and his courage have created a beautiful body of work. He is exemplary.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Jos� Saramago</strong> &nbsp; &#x201c;This is a masterful novel, but for English-speaking readers it is also an overdue one. More Benedetti can&#x2019;t come soon enough, I say.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Malcolm Forbes, <em>The National</em></strong> &nbsp; &#x201c;This is the perfect way to enter the rich and luminous world of Mario Benedetti, one of the great Latin American writers of the past century. He was a prolific poet, novelist, journalist, and master of the short story form, and this sad and beautiful novel brings all of his many talents into focus. Despite the note of alienation that inevitably haunts this novel, <em>Springtime in a Broken Mirror</em> left me in a mood of exultation. The human spirit presses through the cracks in history here, and this novel feels wonderfully fresh, its hero unbowed in the face of exile and bereavement.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Jay Parini, author of <em>The Last Station</em> and <em>The Damascus Road</em></strong> <br>&#x201c;<em>Springtime in a Broken Mirror</em> is written like a psalm&#x2014;a beautiful meditation on exile, dictatorships and the lives elevated and isolated by the struggle against both.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Fatima Bhutto, author of <em>Song of Blood and Sword</em> and <em>The Shadow of the Crescent Moon<br><br></em></strong><strong>Praise for Mario Benedetti:<br></strong>&#x201c;One of Latin America&#x2019;s most respected, popular and prolific writers, who excelled as a novelist, poet, playwright and essayist while immersing himself in the region&#x2019;s political struggles.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong><em>The New York Times<br><br></em></strong>&#x201c;In Latin America and Spain, [Benedetti] is remembered above all as a poet who sought to speak of love and political commitment as directly and passionately as possible.

It is telling that the major sections of the book are organized by war--Sinai Campaign, Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, Lebanon War. Stirring images of soldiers on the front lines, refugees on the move, an off-duty fighter tending the family barbecue with a gun on his hip, and Druze women in the Golan Heights shouting to their relatives across the border in Syria remind readers of the harsh reality behind the headlines. Many photographs capture quieter, more personal moments, such as a Greek Orthodox wedding, a man visiting the Tel Aviv zoo, and a woman soothing her infant outside a kibbutz dining hall. Individually the pictures tell thousands of different--even divisive--stories of the people in and around Israel. When regarded collectively, though, these provocative images form a portrait of a nation struggling to find its place. An essay by Thomas L. Friedman, the <i>New York Times</i>'s Jerusalem correspondent, explores the contradictions that are elemental to the country, introduces the photographs, and leads readers to consider the pictures from many different angles.</p><h2>Interdisciplinary Teaching Through Outdoor Education</h2><p><p><i>Interdisciplinary Teaching Through Outdoor Education</i> provides teachers and recreation and outdoor leaders with outdoor activities as well as the expertise to expand students' understanding of the outdoors and develop their character.

Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br><br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br><br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br><br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Globalization and Crime (Key Approaches to Criminology)</h2><p><p>Globalization &amp; Crime brings together the closely related subjects of criminology and global sociology.

But scientists have often drawn on sensory experiences other than the visual. Since the end of the nineteenth century, biologists have used a variety of techniques to register wildlife sounds. In this book, Joeri Bruyninckx describes the evolution of sound recording into a scientific technique for studying the songs and calls of wild birds and asks, what it means to listen to animal voices as a scientist. </p><p>The practice of recording birdsong took shape at the intersection of popular entertainment and field ornithology, turning recordings into objects of investigation and popular fascination. Shaped by the technologies and interests of amateur naturalism and music teaching, radio broadcasting and gramophone production, hobby electronics and communication engineering, birdsong recordings traveled back and forth between scientific and popular domains, to appear on gramophone recordings, radio broadcasts, and movie soundtracks.</p><p>Bruyninckx follows four technologies&#x2015;the musical score, the electric microphone, the portable magnetic tape recorder, and the sound <br>spectrograph&#x2015;through a cultural history of field recording and scientific listening. He chronicles a period when verbal descriptions, musical notations, and onomatopoeic syllables represented birdsong and shaped a community of listeners; later electric recordings struggled with notions of fidelity, realism, objectivity, and authenticity; scientists, early citizen scientists, and the recording industry negotiated recording exchange; and trained listeners complemented the visual authority of spectrographic laboratory analyses. This book reveals a scientific process fraught with conversions, between field and laboratory, sound and image, science and its various audiences.</p></p><p>Joeri Bruyninckx is Assistant Professor in the Department of Technology and Society Studies at Maastricht University.<p>Birdsong is a charming topic. <i>Listening in the Field</i> not only captures it in a carefully researched account of its study in the age of sound recording. It also shows how fields of expertise collaborated in this endeavor and how their mutual exchange shaped ways of listening to and communicating about sound. The broad range of expertise that Joeri Bruyninckx has worked into the book will make it an interesting read for scholars in sound and music studies, and the histories of science and technology. The outcome is a surprising new perspective</p>&#x2015;<b>Julia Kursell</b>, Professor of Musicology and Codirector of the Vossius Center for the History of Humanities and Sciences, University of Amsterdam<br><br><p>If there is a single work that demonstrates the rich fruits of working at the intersection of sound studies and history of science, it is this book. Tracing out networks of field scientists, amateur birders, technicians, sound engineers, the listening public, and the sounds themselves, Bruyninckx's <i>Listening in the Field</i> is both an important and delightful analysis of the epistemic power of sound and listening.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alexandra Hui</b>, Associate Professor of History, Mississippi State University; author of <i>The Psychophysical Ear</i><br><br><p>A field guide to birdsong biology, <i>Listening in the Field</i> takes the reader on an unconventional tour of sound recording across the last century, from onomatopoeic writing to massive tape archives to digital spectrograms.

Alas, the computer industry thinks it is still in its rebellious teenage years, exulting in technical complexity. Customers want change. They are ready for products that offer convenience, ease of use, and pleasure. The technology should be invisible, hidden from sight.</p><p>In this book, Norman shows why the computer is so difficult to use and why this complexity is fundamental to its nature. The only answer, says Norman, is to start over again, to develop information appliances that fit people's needs and lives. To do this companies must change the way they develop products. They need to start with an understanding of people: user needs first, technology last&#x2015;the opposite of how things are done now.</p></p><p>Currently, computer users must navigate a sea of guidebooks, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and wizards to perform a task such as searching the Web or creating a spreadsheet. While Donald Norman acknowledges that the personal computer allows for "flexibility and power," he also makes its limitations perfectly clear. "The personal computer is perhaps the most frustrating technology ever," he writes. "It should be quiet, invisible, unobtrusive." His vision is that of the "information appliance," digital tools created to answer our specific needs, yet interconnected to allow communication between devices.<p> His solution? "Design the tool to fit so well that the tool becomes a part of the task." He proposes using the PC as the infrastructure for devices hidden in walls, in car dashboards, and held in the palm of the hand. A word of caution: some of Norman's zealotry leads to a certain creepiness (global positioning body implants) and goofiness (electric-power-generating plants in shoes). His message, though, is reasonably situated in the concept that the tools should bend to fit us and our goals: we sit down to write, not to word process; to balance bank accounts, not to fill in cells on a spreadsheet. In evenly measuring out the future of humanity's technological needs--and the limitations of the PC's current incarnation--Norman presents a formidable argument for a renaissance of the information appliance. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i></p><i>Business Week</i> has named Don Norman one of the world's most influential designers.

The expert authors offer an inside view of the workings of this closed system a view rarely found elsewhere in discussions of Soviet affairs. Their work, building as it does on the achievements of Soviet studies over the last thirty years, is firmly rooted in established knowledge and covers sufficient new ground to enable future studies of Soviet politics and social practices to move ahead unencumbered by stereotypes, sensationalism, or mystification. </p><p> Among the subjects included are: attitudes toward leadership and a general discussion of the uses of political history; the dramatic cycles of officially permitted dissent; the legitimacy of leadership within a system that has no constitutional provision for succession; the gradual adoption of Western-inspired administrative procedures and "systems management"; a study of group competition, and bureaucratic bargaining; Khrushchev's virgin-lands experiment and its subsequent retrenchment; the apolitical values of adolescents; the problems of integrating Central Asia into the Soviet system; a history of peaceful coexistence and its current importance in Soviet foreign policy priorities, and, finally, an overview of Soviet government as an extension of prerevolutionary oligarchy, with an emphasis on adaptation to political change. </p></p><p>Paul Cocks is with the Hoover InstitutionThis substantial volume was written and compiled by former students of the late Merle Fainsod, and is dedicated to his memory.

In his account of a year spent studying a flock of wild turkeys in the loblolly pine woods of Florida, he aims to improve their reputation. They are, he notes, masters of disguise, blending in with their surroundings in ways so subtle as to make the work of predators--especially human hunters--difficult. And, he writes, they are &#34;curious to a fault, want a working understanding of every aspect of their surroundings, and their memory is impeccable.&#34; His affectionate portrait may not convince English speakers to stop calling each other turkeys, but it will make welcome reading for birders and wildfowl enthusiasts.Illumination in the Flatwoods is the account of an extraordinary experiment: Naturalist Joe Hutto incubates two dozen wild-turkey eggs with the intention of human-imprinting and raising the hatchlings in the spirit of Konrad Lorenz. But the relationship that develops between the author and the wild birds so profoundly changes his life that he wonders, appropriately, who has imprinted whom.Hutto's is an unforgettable story. Lovingly told with skill and humor, and vibrating with the natural wonders of the Florida flatwoods and the fascinating behavior of the most elusive of the wild game birds, Illumination in the Flatwoods will amaze and enrich all who share this season with the wild turkey.

More than just a critique of the death penalty, Devlin's austere, haunting images extend that critique to an American society in which 70 percent of the citizens support the death penalty. In her photographs, death row and the death chambers are symbolic of American culture and the American psyche. An electric chair in one image, placed in the center of a room amid emptiness and clinical sterility, resembles nothing so much as a throne. Elsewhere, the somber cross-like stretcher used for lethal injections invokes the execution as religious ritual, complete with a captivated audience.

The author emphasizes the part played by economic problems, pacifist sentiment and the failure of the disarmament conference in influencing the thinking of policy makers, and discusses Britain&#39;s dilemma of trying to provide for defence in Europe while maintaining the facade of an imperial power. Although Britain did not seek to challenge Japan&#39;s China policy, she was not prepared to give Japan a free hand in China, or to grant concessions elsewhere. In practice, British attempts to rehabilitate China appeared as a challenge to Japan. This was particularly true of the Leith Ross mission in China in 1935, which is considered in detail in this book.</p><p>This is a study of Britain&#39;s attempts after the Manchurian crisis of 1931-3 to redefine her aims in east Asia and to develop a viable policy of friendship towards China and goodwill towards Japan.</p><h2>Knowledge and Persuasion in Economics</h2><p>Donald McCloskey&#39;s previous books, The Rhetoric of Economics and If You&#39;re So Smart, aimed to bring economics back into the wider conversation of the day. In Knowledge and Persuasion in Economics he carries the conversation further, into the seminars of philosophers. His message is that economics is a science, but a human science. It is properly mathematical, but literary too. His book is highly unusual: a work of technical economics that can be read by anyone, a witty guide to the ins and outs of economic philosophy expressed in plain English.</p><p>A work of technical economics that can be read by anyone as well as a witty guide to the ins and outs of economic philosophy, this unusual book&#39;s message to philosophers is that economics is a human science that is &#34;literary&#34; as well as &#34;mathematical&#34;."...witty, learned, inventive, disputatious, stylish, and aimed at the heart of economics as a discipline." Business History Review<br><br>"McCloskey's book is well written and covers a remarkable breadth of methodology in economic science, which will not fail to stir the economist's interests and protest, though most economists are not familiar with them. It is also provocative, evocative, and most of all entertaining." The Southern Economic Journal<br><br>"If you have a serious interest in the human sciences and you enjoy dazzling intellectual aerobics, then McCloskey's writing is for you. He brings to his exposition an extraordinary grasp of literature, literary criticism, poetry, history, philosophy, and the natural and social sciences, and delivers his message with stunning ingenuity and flourish. Reading McCloskey s fun. Whatever you learn is a bonus." Robert Higgs, Liberty<br><br>"Buy this book....a modest price these days for 400 pages of superb text and 38 pages of rich bibliography. You should definitely read it, because McCloskey writes engagingly about so many matters on which all economists ought to reflect. And you shouldn't read the library copy or a copy borrowed from a friend, because you'll want to underline phrases, bracket paragraphs, and mark items in the bibliography for future consultation." Paul Heyne, Bulletin of the Association of Christian Economists<br><br>"There is no doubt that this latest book has benefitted from the decade that has passed, a decade that witnessed numerous developments in science studies, rhetoric, and philosophy. McCloskey is an intent listener and he integrates the fruits of his omnivorous appetite with the added flavor of his own wittiness and playfulness....His style is provocative and entertaining....In my view, McCloskey's arguments are extremely persuasive." Yuval Yonay, Journal of Economic Literature<br><br>"The book reviewed here is actually the third installment of a trilogy, which began with The Rhetoric of Economics and includes If You're So Smart....To sum up: the views presented in the book are in several aspects richer than McCloskey's earlier views."

The influence of architects ranging from Gaud� to Mendelsohn, from Aalto to Le Corbusier, can be seen in his highly individual designs. Projects such as the ski station at Lago Nero, the Teatro Regio in Turin, and the Lutrario ballroom demonstrated his exceptional powers of imagination.<br><br>With the demolition of his massive masterpiece, the Ippica in Turin, and the destruction of his most prestigious interiors, all that remains today of Mollino's work is his furniture. Drawing on rare photographs and documents, this important monograph reconstructs Mollino's work through more than eighty interiors and pieces of furniture spanning his career, pieces built with such bravura that they often resemble sculpture more than works of industrial design. The impact of Mollino on the recent history of architecture and taste in general is now being increasingly recognized, and this study gives us a detailed picture of his achievements. 360 illustrations, 31 in color.</p><p><b>Giovanni Brino</b> is Associate Professor in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Turin.</p><h2>Literacy for Young Children: A Guide for Early Childhood Educators</h2><p>This research-based guidebook offers PreK and kindergarten teachers easy-to-implement activities to develop oral language, phonological and print awareness, emergent writing, and comprehension skills in diverse classrooms.</p><p><p>Priscilla L.

Younger and younger girls are engaging in adult sexual attitudes and practices, and the pressure to conform means thousands have little self-worth and are vulnerable to exploitation. At the same time, thanks to social media, texting, and chatting services, predators are able to ferret out their victims more easily than ever before. In <i>Walking Prey</i>, advocate and former victim Holly Austin Smith shows how middle class suburban communities are fast becoming the new epicenter of sex trafficking in America. Smith speaks from experience: Without consistent positive guidance or engagement, Holly was ripe for exploitation at age fourteen. A chance encounter with an older man led her to run away from home, and she soon found herself on the streets of Atlantic City. Her experience led her, two decades later, to become one of the foremost advocates for trafficking victims. Smith argues that these young women should be treated as victims by law enforcement, but that too often the criminal justice system lacks the resources and training to prevent the vicious cycle of prostitution. This is a clarion call to take a sharp look at one of the most striking human rights abuses, and one that is going on in our own backyard.</p></p><p><b>Holly Austin Smith </b>is an advocate for human trafficking victims who speaks about her own experience nationwide. After becoming a victim of child sex trafficking at the age of 14, she nearly committed suicide while the man who abducted her served only one year in prison. Her story has been featured on the Dr. Oz show, as well as in the <i>Associated Press</i>, the <i>Richmond Times Dispatch, </i>the <i>Tampa Bay Times,</i> <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, and <i>Dallas Morning News</i>.

It stands above the traditional narratives of slavery and emancipation, achieving that mix of personal truth and intellectual analysis that marks the work of a special few like Frederick Douglass. Her story is chilling, and a strong reminder of our nation's failure to protect its children. What makes "Walking Prey different is the deep and passionate, yet cool and logical, understanding of why and how our nation has failed, and what we should be doing about it. This is a book for everyone and one that is a must read for anyone hoping to see the final end of trafficking and slavery in our country.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kevin Bales, Author and Co-Founder of Free the Slaves</p><p>&#x201c;Walking Prey is by far the clearest and most compelling assessment I've read on the issue of child sex trafficking in the United States. It addresses the primary questions surrounding the issue and then offers practical points of engagement for those wanting to join the fight against it. I would say it's a leading resource for anyone on the frontlines of protecting the innocence of these children in our nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Morgan Perry, Producer of Sex+Money: A National Search For Human Worth</i></p><p>&#x201c;A brave and profoundly important book. In an engaging style and with wisdom gained from terrible personal experience, Holly Smith illuminates the issue of child trafficking and offers practical, compassionate, and useful advice for teenagers, parents, and people in the field. Countering the stereotype of the "victim," she shows what sets many children up for abuse. She also illustrates how advertisers and marketers fuel the commercial and sexual exploitation of children and put all children at risk.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jean Kilbourne, Ed.D., creator of the Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women film series</i></p></p><h2>Native Realm: A Search for Self-Definition</h2><p>Personal experiences underlie a biography of observations in which the author examines himself from a sociological perspective and reflects on the sights, sounds, and civilization of Europe and the United States</p><p><p><b>Czeslaw Milosz</b> received the 1978 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Davidson, who places it in an historical and literary perspective. Ranging from serious cautionary tales about moral corruption to amusing and trenchant social satire, these novels provide today's reader with a unique window into the earliest American popular fiction and way of life.<br> Set in Philadelphia, elroy focuses on the limited options for women in early nineteenth century America. The plot revolves around the dilemma of Mrs. Hamilton, who is suddenly left penniless by the unexpected death of her wealthy husband. Not willing to live in poverty, Mrs. Hamilton sees as her only available recourse her two unmarried daughters. As the daughters make the rounds of the marriage market and suffer the machinations of their mother, <em>Kelroy</em> exposes the contradictions of class interest and the profound limitations women suffered in the political and social economies of the early Republican years.<br> This is the first time Rebecca Rush's novel has been available since the printing of the original, single edition in 1812. With an illuminating introduction by Dana D. Nelson, this exceptional novel is certain to shed new light on the role of women, as well as the state of fiction, in early America.</p><p><p> <em>Kelroy</em>, a nearly-forgotten 1812 novel by Rebecca Rush, combines the refinement of the novel of manners with the Gothic novel&#x2019;s hidden evil to tell the story of the star-crossed lovers Emily Hammond and the romantic Kelroy, whose romance is doomed by the machinations of Emily&#x2019;s mother. Set in the elite world of Philadelphia&#x2019;s Atlantic Rim society, Kelroy transcends the genre of sentimental romance to expose the financial pressures that motivate Mrs. Hammond&#x2019;s gambles. As she sacrifices her daughter to maintain the appearance of urbane wealth, Mrs. Hammond emerges as one of the most compellingly detestable figures in early American literature. </p> <p> Appendices include materials on gender, economics, and marriage; games and dancing; and gambling and the lottery in early urban America.

He lives in Dublin.An engaging if ultimately unsatisfactory argument in favor of the reality of evil by one of Britain's most distinguished Marxist literary critics. Analyzing some of Western literature's major pronouncements on evil from Thomas Aquinas to William Golding, Eagleton (<i>Reason, Faith and Revolution</i>) pieces together what he sees as the defining features of evil in a rather unsystematic way, before grounding his own vision of evil in Freud's notion of the death drive, describing evildoers as suffering from an unbearable sense of non-being which must be taken out on the other. Despite its undeniably enjoyable verve and wit, the book's claims are undermined by a rather arbitrary use of source material as well as a belated and inadequate articulation of its major theoretical claim. Muddy talk about different levels of evil and an undeveloped but evidently important distinction between wickedness and evil suggest that the author's notions on the topic would be better served by a larger, more sustained work. Nonetheless, as an attempt to take seriously the reality of extreme wrongdoing without recourse to either religiously grounded certitudes or a total sociological determinism, it offers a promising alternative. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is this process that prompts the SM compiler(s) to rethink and rework the inherited Jesus tradition. Since the first appearance of the Essays in 1985 - the classic Hermeneia commentary on the SM by the author would be published in 1995 - they have remained essential reading for students of the New Testament and its Hellenistic and Jewish settings. Today, the exciting new ways of reading the Sermon suggested in Betz&#39; seminal work continue to inform our search for a fuller and clearer grasp of the multi-faceted and dynamic world of nascent Christianity, as well as the ongoing quest for the historical Jesus.&#34; -Serge Ruzer Hebrew University of Jerusalem &#34;The perspective that unifies these essays is the assertion that the Sermon on the Mount should be recognized and studied as an independent composition that was compiled prior to its incorporation into the Gospel of Matthew. . . . Betz argues that the Sermon on the Mount is an epitome, that is, a condensation of the teachings of Jesus, collected for the purpose of brevity and precision. Such a genre was useful, because it encouraged a follower or disciple to keep the teacher&#39;s entire system in mind.&#34; -Theology Today HANS DIETER BETZ is Professor Emeritus of New Testament at The Divinity School, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.

The book has been widely successful and served as a wonderful platform for classroom discussions about why students are in school, what do they want to learn, and who they think they want to become. Great praise to Andy Delbanco for writing such a compact book containing both history and wisdom."--<b>Eli C. Goldblatt, Director of First-Year Writing and a professor of English at Temple University</b></p><p>COURSE USE ENDORSEMENT: "Andrew Delbanco's <i>College</i> offers first year undergraduates multiple perspectives onto an experience that each one of them is encountering for the very first time. It is a sophisticated but accessible text that speaks in multiple registers, challenging faculty, professional staff, graduate students, and undergraduates of all ages to think about the past, present, and future of the institution in which they work and live. As a common reading, <i>College</i> provides a framework for the question that every freshman in some way is asking throughout the year--what should college be? That very big question is at the center of a book that asks undergraduates to confront the ethical dilemmas posed by the increasing costs of a higher education that ever fewer people can afford. It also challenges students who will be our future leaders to consider what such inequality might portend for an American democracy whose vitality requires an educated majority citizenry."--<b>Frank Wcislo, Dean of The Ingram Commons, Associate Professor of History and European Studies, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>COURSE USE ENDORSEMENT: "I have been using the book in a freshman seminar in which we are exploring college. Most of the texts we are using are academic satire novels, but we are using Delbanco's book to help us talk about the place of college in American culture. Although some of the students are not as interested in the historical background, they do find his discussion of the current state of college to be interesting and informative. For example, nearly all of my students are on some form of financial aid, and when they read Delbanco's examination of the costs of college, they seem to wake up intellectually. For them, Delbanco's critique speaks directly to their own experiences and frustrations, and they appreciate learning the contexts. More to the point, they deeply appreciate seeing their anxieties about the costs of college are taken seriously enough to warrant such careful attention by Delbanco. My students also found Delbanco's analysis of teaching and learning methods interesting and informative. They have their own opinions about what creates a good classroom experience, but they had never before seen someone examine different classroom methods in a systematic fashion. Delbanco's discussion of "lateral learning" seemed to provoke the most interesting discussion, and we spent almost an entire class session talking about why that might work in some classes but not others and why they liked and disliked that method of classroom management. Delbanco also spoke at one of our campus colloquia, where he was well received. In the question and answer after his talk, one of my students asked a question, and he was impressed by how seriously Delbanco took his question and how carefully he answered. Delbanco's serious response highlights what my students most appreciated in his book. He takes the entire concept of education seriously and demonstrates a deep understanding of not just the state of the university as it applies to faculty and administrators but also the way it affects the largest--and most important--constituency: the students. It was a revelation to my students that someone in Delbanco's position would take the trouble to think about what it means to be a student."--<b>Richard M.

Responding in the affirmative, Code offers a radical alterantive to mainstream philosophy's terms for what counts as knowledge and how it is to be evaluated.</p><p>Code first reviews the literature of established epistemologies and unmasks the prevailing assumption in Anglo-American philosophy that "the knower" is a value-free and ideologically neutral abstraction. Approaching knowledge as a social construct produced and validated through critical dialogue, she defines the knower in light of a conception of subjectivity based on a personal relational model. Code maps out the relevance of the particular people involved in knowing: their historical specificity, the kinds of relationships they have, the effects of social position and power on those relationships, and the ways in which knowledge can change both knower and known. In an exploration of the politics of knowledge that mainstream epistemologies sustain, she examines such issues as the function of knowledge in shaping institutions and the unequal distribution of cognitive resources.</p><p><i>What Can She Know? </i>will raise the level of debate concerning epistemological issues among philosophers, political and social scientists, and anyone interested in feminist theory.</p></p><p><p>Lorraine Code is Associate Professor of Philosophy at York University.</p><p>"This book merits serious discussion and deserves a wide readership among philosophers of all persuasions."</p> (<i>The Philosophical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Wrtitten for philosophers, this work is remarkably lucid and readable, and is accessible to students and faculty in women's studies and philosophy."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>Doctoring the Mind: Why Psychiatric Treatments Fail</h2><p>Why is the Western world&#39;s treatment of mental illness so flawed? Who really benefits from psychiatry? And why would a patient in Nigeria have a much greater chance of recovery than one in the UK? In Doctoring the Mind, leading clinical psychologist Richard Bentall reveals the shocking truths behind the system of mental health care in the West. With a heavy dependence on pills and the profit they bring, psychiatry has been relying on myths and misunderstandings of madness for too long, and builds on methods which can often hinder rather than help the patient. Bentall argues passionately for a new future of mental health, one that considers the patient as an individual and redefines our understanding and treatment of madness for the twenty-first century.</p><p>Richard Bentall has held chairs in clinical psychology at the universities of Liverpool and Manchester, and is currently Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Bangor in Wales. Known internationally for his research into the causes and treatment of severe mental illness, his previous book, Madness Explained: Psychosis and Human Nature won the British Psychological Society Book Award for 2004.Clinical and research psychologist Bentall (Madness Explained: Psychosis and Human Nature) studies the effectiveness of different treatments for schizophrenic and bipolar disorders. In this thorough research overview, Bentall concludes that the "medical approach" is "fatally flawed," and "the way that psychiatric drugs are used needs to change radically." In his view, most psychiatric diagnoses fail at predicting the outcome of treatment, particularly drug treatment, because they are based upon faulty assumptions about the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders and a false distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Bentall looks at treatment practices and their study over the past century, particularly in the U.K., including a critical examination of twin studies that improperly claim a correlation between the mental health of parents and their adopted children, and in-depth analysis of recent studies that falsely attribute positive effects to anti-psychotic drug treatment while misrepresenting harmful side-effects. This controversial book makes an important contribution to the broader health-care debate regarding mental health and the role of the pharmaceutical industry. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Authors take the students through details of selling skills, and describe the ways to develop relationship selling.

Its approach is very contemporary. Particularly insightful for postgraduate students with many valuable supporting learning material. This text will be recommended to all my students on 'selling and sales strategies' modules.' -<em> Tony Douglas, Edinburgh Napier University Business School, Edinburgh</em></p> <p>'This textbook facilitates an outstanding introduction to business-to-business selling. New sales students often approach selling with some skepticism and bring with them the stereotype of the salesperson as a mere product peddler willing to manipulate naive prospects. <em>Contemporary Selling </em>will open students' eyes to the concept of the mutually beneficial exchange - in the competitive marketplace, sellers can only satisfy customers by building relationships that center around the customer's needs and customers will only commit to sellers willing to do so. I have used previous editions of this book and have found it invaluable - the new edition's inclusion of sales technology is particularly exciting. With this textbook, Dr. Johnston and Dr. Marshall are providing an outstanding resource at a particularly critical time when students need to understand the true nature of selling and the vital role that salespeople play in fostering a functioning marketplace and a thriving economy.' - <em>Ronald L.&nbsp;Jelinek, PhD., Providence College, USA</em></p> <p>"If you are hunting for a book to teach young college students the art and science of modern selling, look no further than <em>Contemporary Selling </em>by&nbsp;Mark Johnston and Greg Marshall.&nbsp;The book must rank among the top few on the subject.

Motels, home trailers, drive-ins, barbecues, beach life and surfing, sports from polo and tennis and golf to mountain climbing and skiing, "sportswear" (a word coined at the time), and sun suits were all a part of the good life--perhaps California's most distinctive influence of the 1930s. In <em>The Dream Endures</em>, Kevin Starr shows how the good life prospered in California--in pursuits such as film, fiction, leisure, and architecture--and helped to define American culture and society then and for years to come.<br>Starr previously chronicled how Californians absorbed the thousand natural shocks of the Great Depression--unemployment, strikes, Communist agitation, reactionary conspiracies--in <em>Endangered Dreams</em>, the fourth volume of his classic history of California. In <em>The Dream Endures</em>, Starr reveals the other side of the picture, examining the newly important places where the good life flourished, like Los Angeles (where Hollywood lived), Palm Springs (where Hollywood vacationed), San Diego (where the Navy went), the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (where Einstein went and changed his view of the universe), and college towns like Berkeley. We read about the rich urban life of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in newly important communities like Carmel and San Simeon, the home of William Randolph Hearst, where, each Thursday afternoon, automobiles packed with Hollywood celebrities would arrive from Southern California for the long weekend at Hearst Castle.<br>The 1930s were the heyday of the Hollywood studios, and Starr brilliantly captures Hollywood films and the society that surrounded the studios. Starr offers an astute discussion of the European refugees who arrived in Hollywood during the period: prominent European film actors and artists and the creative refugees who were drawn to Hollywood and Southern California in these years--Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Man Ray, Bertolt Brecht, Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Mann, and Franz Werfel. Starr gives a fascinating account of how many of them attempted to recreate their European world in California and how others, like Samuel Goldwyn, provided stories and dreams for their adopted nation. Starr reserves his greatest attention and most memorable writing for San Francisco. For Starr, despite the city's beauty and commercial importance, San Francisco's most important achievement was the sense of well-being it conferred on its citizens. It was a city that "magically belonged to everyone."<br>Whether discussing photographers like Edward Weston and Ansel Adams, "hard-boiled fiction" writers, or the new breed of female star--Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, Bette Davis, Carole Lombard, and the improbable Mae West--<em>The Dream Endures</em> is a brilliant social and cultural history--in many ways the most far-reaching and important of Starr's California books.<br></p><p>The late 1930s and early 1940s introduced to California culture some of the features that still characterize it today, at least in the view of outsiders to the Golden State: surfing, drive-in movie theaters, barbecues, motels, polo shirts, and recreational vehicles. The period brought equally enduring but less superficial changes, too: advances and setbacks alike in race relations, resource management, urban development, and transportation. Kevin Starr continues his multivolume history of California with this deeply learned, always fascinating account of California at the dawn of the modern age, with a cast of characters ranging from the Native American hermit Fig Tree John to violinist Yehudi Menuhin and hardboiled-fiction master Raymond Chandler.10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Theories of Ethics (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)</h2><p>These important essays by leading thinkers center around two principal topics: the nature of moral judgement, and the part played by social utility in determining right and wrong.

Cunningham, Indiana University</b></p><h2>From Out of the Shadows: Mexican Women in Twentieth-Century America</h2><p>For centuries, Mexican-American women have been creative, innovative forces shaping the cultural and economic development of what is now the American Southwest. Whether living in a labor camp, a boxcar settlement, or an urban barrio, Mexican women nurtured families, worked for wages, built extended networks, and participated in community associations--efforts that solidified the community and helped Mexican Americans find their own place in America. Now, in <em>From Out of the Shadows</em>, historian Vicki L. Ruiz provides the first full study of Mexican-American women in the 20th century, in a narrative enhanced by interviews and personal stories that capture a vivid sense of the <em>Mexicana</em> experience in the United States.<br> Beginning with the first wave of women crossing the border early this century, Ruiz reveals the struggles they have faced, the communities they have built, and also highlights the various forms of political protest they have initiated. What emerges from the book is a portrait of a distinctive culture in America that has slowly gathered strength in the last 95 years. <em>From Out of the Shadows</em> is an important addition to the largely undocumented history of Mexican-American women in our century.</p><p><br><strong>Vicki L. Ruiz</strong> is Professor of History and Chicana-Chicano Studies at Arizona State University.<br>"Ruiz succeeds in bringing overdue attention to the long ignored or, at best, marginalized history of Mexican women in this country....Ruiz's book is of special value for two groups of readers: historians, who must grapple with gender issues if they are to write more in-depth works on Mexican<br>Americans, and individuals who are new to the study of Mexican women's lives in the United States. For both, Ruiz has written a well-documented account of women who made history in their communities and thereby in America."--Southwestern Historical Quarterly<br><br>"In synthesizing a wealth of information on a relatively neglected topic into a stirring portrayal of women's courage and agency, Ruiz's book epitomizes illuminative scholarship."--Latin American Research Review<br><br>"Impressive telling of the often overlooked and important history of Chicana women in the United States."--Marc S. Rodriguez, University of Wisconsin at Madison<br><br>"An outstanding contribution to Chicana and Chicano history. Very scholarly and informative."--John E. Valdez, Palomar College<br><br>"Beautifully written! Well done. A must for any Chicano history course at any level. Well-researched and well-documented. Important addition to Chicano/a literature."--Gilbert Montemayor, McLennan Community College<br><br>"With subtlety and nuance, Vicki Ruiz has written a narrative that, for the first time, illuminates the complexity and richness of the experience of Mexican American women in the 20th century United States. Brilliantly drawing upon interviews as well as more traditional materials, Ruiz vividly<br>portrays the stress, tensions, and triumphs of generations who sought to endure and prosper in a new land, even as they struggled to maintain a sense of distinctive family and cultural traditions. This is an extraordinary achievement."--William H. Chafe, Professor of History, Duke University<br><br>"From Out of the Shadows has much to recommend it. Feminists will find it a rich source book and an excellent overview of Mexican American women's crucial contributions to labor organizing, community formation and social movements in the West and Southwest."--Louise Lamphere,The Women's<br>Review of Books, Wellesley College</p>
